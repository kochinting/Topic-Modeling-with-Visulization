GREAT MUSIC BY DUCE BLOW
CUUURRSSEEEE YOOUUUU EEEUURRROOOBOOOYYSSSS
This is what first got me into jazz 15 years ago in college.  It was enough that I only listened to this album for months. I didn't need anything else.

Thanks for reminding me that this existed, its been too long.
"I credit this song with ~~destroying my relationship~~ showing me what an asshole my ex was."

Fixed that for you.
Still, that album matters more than about any in the 57 years since, in any genre.  Perfect expositional improvisation.
**JOE MORELLO IS GOD.**

I understand how good Buddy Rich was, and I understand how and why, coming from vaudeville, Buddy was such a showman.  But I just can't stand it; I can't stand watching him, because every performance I see of Buddy just reeks "LOOK AT ME!"

And then...there's Joe.  Very little facial expression, very subtle movement, very reserved...and just freaking KILLING.  He was every bit as good as Buddy, if not better.

[This is my absolute favorite filmed version of "Take Five."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT1FHNrmPj8)  Joe's solo starts around 2:45 with him putting down his sticks and using his hands.  Then around 4:30 watch his left hand - WOW!  And that bass drum creep!

There's a reason Joe was such an influence on 60's rock drummers like Moon, Bonham, and Baker, and I think this video really shows it.
Just gotta stress "to."

Jake?
Check out his playing on YouTube with Dave Holland on metamorphosis.  He's playing alto, and really displays his mastery and unique alto approach on that tune.  Recently, he's said alto is a discipline unto itself that he has given up, and I'm like WTF?
I feel that way about Oscars Peterson's Christmas album. It's the only Christmas music I'll listen too.
I'd argue the head to Blue Rondo is 9/8!

"Everybody gotta struggle, that's the way of the world
Can't develop biceps if you don't do curls
Can't achieve a garden if you never water your crops
If you never paid your dues, then you don't get props

Glendale, AZ I take it? Pretty ghetto school from the looks of it.
The backbeat from Led Zeppelin, chant from Taiwan.  Disputed and settled.  The entire album was an emotional rollercoaster of affectation. Meaning?  If you were alive when this was released, it affected you.  It was that potent.
I still think Siamese Dream is the greatest album to come out of '90s alt-rock. There's not a single song on there that isn't just absolutely beautiful.

Popol Vuh - nice. Florian Fricke put out some great albums. What are your favourites?
Yep. A huge turning point for jazz as well. The next ten years saw the genre morph into something completely different. Miles was always at the center of it all too.
What about jaco?

> Strung Out is a punk rock band from Simi Valley, California, USA, formed in 1992. They are known mainly for their musical style, which fuses aspects of punk rock and metal to form their primary sound. They have released nine albums on Fat Wreck Chords and appeared on numerous compilations and skate/surf videos. They have played on the Warped Tour and continue to tour internationally.

> The original lineup consisted of vocalist Jason Cruz, guitarists Jake Kiley and Rob Ramos, bassist Jim Cherry and drummer Adam Austin. After releasing a self-titled 7" record, they became one of the first bands to be signed to Fat Wreck Chords, the record label owned and operated by Fat Mike of the band NOFX. Austin left the band in 1992 and was replaced by Brad Morrison who also left the band and was replaced on drums by Jordan Burns, formerly of fellow Simi Valley natives Ten Foot Pole. Their first album, Another Day in Paradise, was released in May of 1994. Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues followed in 1996. In 1998 they released The Skinny Years...Before We Got Fat, a compilation album of their pre-Fat Wreck Chords material.

> The band showed notable musical growth on their 1998 album Twisted by Design, which was both speedy and technical but also punk-based and with darker overtones. The album established a mixture of the fast, poppy sound the band had established with Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues but mixed it with more atonality and more abstract song structures. Bassist Jim Cherry left the band in 1999 and went on to play in Pulley and Zero Down, but died of heart failure in 2002. He was replaced by Chris Aiken, whose musical background had a strong impact on the 2000 album The Element of Sonic Defiance, which continued in the fast, melodic punk tradition of the band while introducing more hard rock and metal elements.

> In 2002 the band released their fourth full-length album An American Paradox, their first release to appear in the Billboard Top 200. The initial production run contained a bonus song entitled "Don't Look Back". A video was filmed for the song "Cemetery" and was included on several punk rock video compilations. In 2003 they recorded and released a live album as part of the Fat Wreck Chords Live in a Dive series. Exile in Oblivion, was released in 2004, with a video filmed for the song "Analog." Strung Out released their sixth full-length album, Blackhawks Over Los Angeles on June 12, 2007.

> In March 2009, Strung Out released a compilation of B-sides, demos, and covers called "Prototypes and Painkillers" with material from all eras of the band's history. Many of these tracks have been on various punk compilations and/or were included in their "Live in a Dive" recording.

> On September 29, 2009, Strung Out Released a their 7th studio album titled Agents of the Underground. Read more on Last.fm.

Stax?
Classic tune. The quality of the recording amazes me to this day. How did they get a drum sound that good in 1959?
came to pay my respects.  I don't know jazz/listen to jazz/think i like jazz.  but in high school band i fully remember Take Five and the weird ass time signatures and shit.. it changed music for me. honestly.. one of my favorite bands is Dillinger Escape Plan for their insane timings. long shot if anyone can relate to this but yah, throwin it out there =)
Hey A7x!!

**Charlie Daniels Band**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/3425739e0c994f49b571014af53a92ff.png)  

> The Charlie Daniels Band is an American country and southern rock band led by Charlie Daniels.

> The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with Charlie Daniels joined by Barry Barnes (guitar), Mark Fitzgerald (bass), Fred Edwards and Gary Allen (drums), and Taz DiGregorio (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for Kama Sutra. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style "Uneasy Rider", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, "The South's Gonna Do It". In 1974, Daniels had members of The Marshall Tucker Band and The Allman Brothers Band join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as James Brown performing with Roy Acuff, and the stylistic mergers have included Crystal Gayle singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band. 

> The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's 'Nightrider", with Tom Crain, Charlie Hayward and Don Murray replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to Epic in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his "Million Mile Reflections" album, he recalled a 20s poem, "The Mountain Whipporwill", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into "The Devil Went Down To Georgia", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success. 

> In 1980 the band recorded "In America" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, "Still In Saigon", about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie "Stroker Ace". The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie "Lone Star Kid" and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences. 

> In the late 1980s and 1990s, several of Daniels' albums and singles were hits on the Country charts and the music continues to receive airplay on country stations today. Daniels also released several Gospel and Christian records.

**Jawbreaker**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/d1db5eb8ca4a44cc952dd0a3ead6d59f.png)  

> Jawbreaker was an American punk rock band from San Francisco, California, United States. The band has its root in Los Angeles, CA, where Blake Schwarzenbach and Adam Pfahler were students at the exclusive private Crossroads High School. The band came together when they met Chris Bauermeister at New York University in 1988.

> With Schwarzenbach on guitar and vocals, Bauermeister on bass, and Pfahler on drums, the band gained recognition in the late eighties and early nineties for their melodic yet driven sound built on the foundation for Schwarzenbach's poignant, bleeding-heart lyrics and signature rasp.  

> The band's first full-length release Unfun was put out by Shredder in 1990. On this, the band stuck close to the sound coming out of their contemporaries in the nascent pop punk scene in their sound, with the exception of Bauermeister's prominent bass lines and Schwarzenbach's lyrics, at times walking the line of the melodramatic.

> Unfun was followed by Bivouac on Tupelo/Communion in 1992. Bivouac proved thicker and darker - both thematically and melodically - yet served to elevate the band above a crowd of previously similar acts. This more ambitious release also artfully used pieces of found-audio, in what was becoming one of the band's signatures, weaving it in and out of the ten minute title track, "Bivouac."

> Their third release, 24 Hour Revenge Therapy, produced by the ubiquitous Steve Albini, unveiled a sparse pop-punk with more carefully crafted lyrics. This album also holds what has become arguably their best known song, "Boxcar."

> Jawbreaker had seemed poised for critical and commercial success by the time of their fourth, and last album, Dear You. Despite a vigorous marketing push, Jawbreaker's album sales were anemic in the wake of a post-Green Day market, and was one of the causes leading to the end of the band's career in 1996.

> The group recently reacquired the rights to Dear You and have successfully put the long out-of-print album back into circulation on Pfahler's label, Blackball Records.

> The band's cult status as the definitive nineties proto-pop-punk band has grown since its breakup, and songs like "Kiss the Bottle" and "Jet Black" are referenced as influences by bands such as Sparta, Lucero, and Rocky Votolato.

> The King Khan & BBQ Show are a Canadian Garage rock duo from Montreal, Quebec that originally existed from roughly 2002 up until an incident at the group's massive Sydney Opera House show in early-June, 2010. The band was comprised of former The Spaceshits bandmates Mark Sultan and Blacksnake, but included live drummer/organist Leo Chips for a short spurt of shows on the 2009 Invisible Girl U.S. tour. Mark Sultan, under the pseudonym BBQ, contributed vocals, guitar, tambourine, bass drum, and snare drum; while Blacksnake, currently using the pseudonym King Khan, provided lead guitar and vocals.

> Both BBQ and King Khan had previously collaborated together while the two were members of the Montreal-based Spaceshits, however, following a European tour, Blacksnake (the then-current alias of King Khan) opted to remain in Germany on a permanent basis, resulting in the ultimate breakup of the Spaceshits, who chose not to continue without Blacksnake. Following the breakup of the Spaceshits, Mark Sultan started another Montreal-based band, Les Sexareenos, before venturing off on his own as a one-man band under the pseudonym BBQ. It was as BBQ that Mark Sultan re-established contact with Blacksnake, playing alongside Blacksnake's new band, King Khan & The Shrines. The two began writing songs together at Blacksnake's apartment in Germany, playing them live at sporadic shows around Germany and Spain.

> In 2004 the band recorded their first album as The King Khan & BBQ Show, releasing The King Khan & BBQ Show in America on Goner Records, and on Hazelwood Records in Europe. The album was recorded by DM Bob in Hamburg, Germany. In support of the album, the band began a world tour, with stops in Europe, the US, and South America. In 2006 the band released their second LP, What's for Dinner?, on In the Red Records. In 2008, Impose Magazine crowned King Khan the best performer of 2008.On July 31, 2009, Pitchfork Media reported that King Khan & BBQ will be releasing Invisible Girl in November. They embarked on a forty day US/Canada tour to coincide with the release. On November 12, while on tour in the United States, Khan and tour manager Kristin Klein were arrested in Kentucky on illegal drug possession charges. Klein was also booked for driving with an invalid license. She entered a guilty plea and will appear in court on April 2, 2010. The band missed three shows due to the holdup. Invisible Girl was released on December 1, 2009.

> Khan and BBQ were not on speaking terms for a period, following a dispute after certain incidents involving the crowd and subsequent management complaints at a gig in June, 2010 at the historic Sydney Opera House, curated by Lou Reed and his wife Laurie Anderson. Following King Khan's guitar-throwing episode with the crowd after warnings from the Opera House staff, BBQ and the former exchanged some heated words and agreed that this show would be their last.
A remorseful King Khan detailed the undertakings in an online posting:

> On July 13, 2012, The King Khan & BBQ Show reunited for the first time since the Sydney show, for a sold-out performance at Lee's Palace in Toronto. They played an hour-long set to the packed club and ended with a three-song encore. The group are now officially back together and touring. Read more on Last.fm.

> Francis Albert Sinatra (born December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey; died May 14, 1998 in Los Angeles, California) was an Italian American Grammy Award winning jazz singer, Academy Award winning actor, founder of Reprise Records and member of The Rat Pack. Beginning his musical career in the Swing Era along with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a highly successful solo artist, releasing 59 studio albums and becoming the idol of the 'bobby soxers'.

> His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs For Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly With Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. Sinatra turned fifty in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, and scored hits with "Strangers in the Night" and "My Way". Sinatra attempted to weather the changing tastes in popular music, but with dwindling album sales and after appearing in several poorly received films, he retired in 1971. Coming out of retirement in 1973, he recorded several albums, scoring a hit with "(Theme From) New York, New York", and toured both within the United States and internationally until a few years before his death in 1998.

> Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and had three children; Nancy, Frank Jr. and Tina by his first wife Nancy Barbato. He was married three more times, to the actresses Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and finally to Barbara Marx, to whom he was married at his death.

> Sinatra is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century, Sinatra had a popularity that was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. American music critic Robert Christgau called him "the greatest singer of the 20th century".

**Maestro Fresh Wes**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/c7fef4f8fa864c5a8d2fd4025a450ced.png)  

> Maestro Fresh Wes (b. Wesley Williams 1968) is a Canadian hip-hop musician from Toronto. Previously known as Maestro Fresh Wes before shortening his name to Maestro in the late 1990's, he was in 1989 the first Canadian rapper to have a Top 40 hit, "Let Your Backbone Slide". As of 2006, in fact, "Let Your Backbone Slide" remained the best-selling Canadian hip hop single until 2008.

> His debut album Symphony In Effect was released in 1989. After his 1991 album, The Black Tie Affair, Maestro's career faltered as he attempted to break into the United States market. However, he returned to the Canadian charts in 1998, with the hit singles "Stick to Your Vision" and "416/905 (TO Party Anthem)".

> In 2005, Maestro covered Lawrence Gowan's song "A Criminal Mind"; Gowan appears in the video and his vocals are sampled on the track.

> Williams has also been an actor, most notably in the Omni Television series Metropia. As an actor, he is normally credited as either Wesley Williams, Wes Williams, or Wesley Paris. In addition, he has had small roles in Honey (2003) and Four Brothers (2005). He was set to appear as a security guard in 50 Cent's film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005), but his scenes were deleted from the film. He has a supporting role in Instant Star as Darius Mills.

> Maestro was born to Guyanese parents and was raised in Scarborough, Ontario. He has previously been romantically linked to Canadian television journalist Marci Ien. Read more on Last.fm.

**The Black Crowes**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/baeba91b1c0e429c96e1f6e59ddc06f2.png)  

> The Black Crowes was a blues-oriented hard rock jam band formed 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States that has sold over 15 million albums and were hailed by Melody Maker as "The Most Rock N' Roll Rock N' Roll Band In The World" The band has toured with acts such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Jimmy Page, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Oasis and Lenny Kravitz. The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock".

> At the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.

> The Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). "Jealous Again," the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's "Hard to Handle" that made the group a multi-platinum success. "Hard to Handle" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad "She Talks to Angels" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.

> The Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only "Remedy" and "Thorn in My Pride" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.

> Three Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.

> The Black Crowes have since reunited.  All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White.  They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005.  In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which was released in March of 2008.  Read more on Last.fm.

If I remember my RHCP history correctly (I think it was on behind the music), this song was made for his ex girlfriend Sinead O'Connor. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

I'd also like to add that this song has a lot of meaning for me as well, stupid feelings and sharing of said feelings.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9afafd95b4908c290029b5bbc6440119.png)  

> Roots Manuva, born Rodney Smith is a British hip-hop artist, who mixes hip hop with reggae and dub as well as electronica, and even some gospel. He grew up around Stockwell in South London. His parents were from a small village in Jamaica called Banana Hole where his father was a preacher and tailor. Spending much of his early years in poverty, this and his strict Pentecostal upbringing clearly had an influence on his music as can be seen in many of his tracks such as "Sinny Sin Sins" and "Colossal Insight".

> Smith made his recorded debut in 1994 as part of IQ Procedure through Suburban Baseâs short-lived hip hop imprint Bluntly Speaking Vinyl. He debuted as Roots Manuva the same year on Blak Twang's "Queenâs Headâ single, before releasing his own single, âNext Type of Motionâ the following year. 1996 saw the release of his collaborations with Skitz (âWhere My Mind Is Atâ/âBlessed Be the Mannerâ). The release of âFevaâ followed in 1997; this was also the year that saw the first releases from Big Dada, a collaboration between Coldcutâs Ninja Tune label and hip hop journalist Will Ashon.

> Releasing for Coldcut's renowned experimental/hip-hop label Ninja Tune in 1998, some of his music may be seen as a predecessor of grime. The following year he released his fearsome debut album, âBrand New Second Handâ. Manuva was rewarded for his breakthrough with a MOBO as Best Hip Hop Act that year. He has also relesed 2001's âRun Come Save Meâ, followed the next year by âDub Come Save Meâ in, which features dub remixes of five songs from the previous album alongside new work. This was followed up with the release of âAwfully Deepâ in 2005 and âAlternately Deepâ in 2006.

> The lyrics of his songs are usually known to take a distinctly British edge, with many critics highlighting his references of eating cheese on toast and drinking bitter as examples of this. His warm and easily recognizable voice can be heard on many songs he performed with other artists such as Chali 2na (of Jurassic 5 & Ozomatli), DJ Shadow, U.N.K.L.E., Nightmares on Wax, The Cinematic Orchestra, Beth Orton and Leftfield. He also made an appearance on the Gorillaz latest album, Demon Days, lending his distinctive vocals to the track, "All Alone". Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/629e1b98d65a474aa77df86d6c4ab7d9.png)  

> The Go-Go's are an all-female American rock and roll group that formed in 1978. They made history as the first all-woman band in pop music that played their own instruments and wrote their own songs to top the Billboard charts with a #1 album. Stylistically, their energetic music spanned punk, surf rock, new wave, power pop, and more. They rose to fame in the early-80s with a sunny, retro public image, and their unlikely success helped ushered in an era of similar bands and music in the U.S.

> Their best known tunes include "Our Lips Our Sealed", "Vacation", and "We Got The Beat" among others. Their trend-setting debut album, 'Beauty and the Beat', didn't just reach #1 after its 1981 release but is also considered one of the cornerstone albums of American new wave. In the beginning, they played primarily what was known as 'pop punk', and they then made their sound more sunny and romantic, having later associated themselves with the distinct sound of 80s pop rock. The Go-Go's had five Top 40 hits in their heyday.

> In addition, there was a group from Newcastle in the U.K. known as "The Go-Go's" in the 60s. That artist is known for their 1964 novelty Christmas single, titled "I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek", which referenced the budding 'Doctor Who' craze. Like the later U.S. band of the same name, the group's name was a reference to go-go dancing. Read more on Last.fm.

> The Magic City Hippies began as a one-man band playing for the co-ed party scene on the streets of Miami -- serenading the 20-somethings with a mix of old-school hip-hop covers and original tunes.

> After months of stealing electricity and stirring up crowds of passers-by with his loop-based setup, frontman Robby Hunter was asked by the Coconut Grove Police to cease and desist or 'play in a real bar.'  Finding sanctuary in a nearby dive bar, Robby enlisted the support of multi-instrumentalists Pat Howard and John Coughlin for a regular gig.

> This trio dubbed itself Robby Hunter Band and released a self-produced, widely acclaimed debut LP in 2013 entitled Magic City Hippies, which included the beachy Hype Machine #1 Hit "CorazÃ³n" alongside major blog hits "Hard On Me" and "BUSTâ and album cuts that can be heard on episodes of major network shows like The CWâs âiZombieâ and Showtimeâs âRay Donovan.â

> Encouraged by the international reach and positive reception of their debut, they decided to expand their sound and approach under the new moniker Magic City Hippies (after the title of their debut LP).  In July of 2015, the Magic City Hippies released the Hippie Castle EP, and the lead-off track "Fanfare" hit #1 on Spotify's Global Viral Top 50 in the US, UK, and Canada.  It has since accumulated over 1.9 million streams.

> The single âHUSH' is the Hippies' latest handiwork, the first piece of a new full length album planned for release in summer 2016 amidst a string of upcoming US tour dates. Read more on Last.fm.

**Barry Adamson**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/8a5c91a11bd1480cba07cc2963cf701d.png)  

> Audio artist Barry Adamson started out as bass player for British punk band Magazine, however, he's since carved more of a name for himself equally for being a founding member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and also for composing a large chunk of the score of David Lynch's Lost Highway. Adamson's solo work varies heavily between Film Noir and classic to industrial rock, whilst taking in everything in between, making him almost impossible to pigeonhole.

> Adamson left school and shifted into graphic design attending Stockport Art College[3] but quit shortly after, favouring to venture into the exploding punk rock scene of the late 1970s. He joined ex-Buzzcocks singer Howard Devoto's band Magazine, playing bass guitar, scoring one chart single, "Shot by Both Sides"; in late 1977, he also joined Buzzcocks, as a short-time replacement of Garth Smith. He played on all of Magazine's albums, and contributed to Devoto's solo album and his next band, Luxuria. He also contributed to the studio-based band Visage, playing on the ensemble's first two albums, Visage and The Anvil.

> After Magazine broke up, Adamson worked with another ex-Buzzcock, Pete Shelley, before joining Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He appeared on five of that band's albums: From Her to Eternity; The Firstborn Is Dead; Kicking Against the Pricks; Your Funeral, My Trial; and Tender Prey. After his stint in the band, he went solo, releasing an EP, The Man with the Golden Arm in 1988, and his first solo album, Moss Side Story, the following year, the soundtrack to a non-existent film noir.[4] The album incorporated newscasts and sampled sound effects and featured guest musicians Marcia Schofield (of The Fall), Diamanda Galas, Roland S. Howard, and former colleagues from the Bad Seeds.[4] Adamson's second solo album was the soundtrack to a real film this time - Carl Colpaert's Delusion, and he would go on to provide sountracks for several other films.[4]

> Adamson's third album, Soul Murder, was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize in 1992.[4][5]
His solo work is influenced by John Barry, Elmer Bernstein and Ennio Morricone. Later works have included jazz, electronica, soul, funk, and dub styles.
In 2002, Adamson left his long-term label, Mute Records, and started his own 'production home', Central Control International. In 2006, he released Stranger on the Sofa, first for his Central Control International imprint, to critical acclaim. Back To The Cat, his second album for the label, was released in March 2008.[1]

> In 2007 it was announced that Magazine would reform for concerts in 2008. Adamson will be part of this and the same line up that recorded Secondhand Daylight will reform, with the exception of the late John McGeoch. McGeoch will be replaced by Luxuria/Apollo 440 member Noko. Read more on Last.fm.

> No Cash were a political riot ska-core band that burst into the late nineties scene with cutting riffs and lyrics that spoke of injustice and hate across the globe.  They were often compared to Leftover Crack, Choking Victim and INDK .

> No Cash Has sold over 1,000 copies of their only album and are continuing to gain popularity.

> As of early 2005, they have broken up.

> Brief history:

> No Cash was founded in Nazareth, PA.  They recorded a split CD with New York based band Team Spider. Their debut solo album, Run Your Pockets, sold well.  Due to differences within the band, they broke up in 2005. Their music continues to sell today and No Cash has developed a devoted group of fans . They have said a reunion show is impossible. Nonetheless, their music will continue to speak volumes to teenagers living in hostile environments. Read more on Last.fm.

This is awesome, we were just learning about this band in jazz history!
I love it when people say Kanye "ripped off" Daft Punk. I like Daft Punk a lot, but the reality is that some of their best known songs are literally other peoples' songs with new vocals. [This might sound familiar to you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3AKrwna2C8)
80s Pink Floyd?
So I teach 2nd grade and I played this album for my students one morning to be informed it sounds like the dentist.
Though they weren't really first, what makes The Original Dixieland Jass Band inauthentic? Were they not playing authentic jazz?
First heard this song as the theme of a favorite show of mine on PBS. I think it was in syndication from BBC... cannot remember the name of that show for the life of me, but I can see the face of the host. 

Such a fantastic tune!

**Screeching Weasel**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/7e80ed256ede4a05bcca006d9f8e5f23.png)  

> Screeching Weasel is an American punk band from Chicago, Illinois. They were formed in 1986 by Ben Weasel (aka Ben Foster who also used to be a columnist for the punk fanzine Maximum Rocknroll) and John Jughead (aka John Pierson). The band gained prominence in the early 1990s after signing to East Bay punk label, Lookout! Records and are cited to be a major influence over many bands playing that style of punk music.

> Through the years, the band went through many line-up changes, with Ben and John being the only constant members since the band's inception.  Screeching Weasel officially broke up for (roughly) the third - and allegedly final - time on July 6, 2001.
The band did a few surprise shows between 2001-2009.

> Ben Weasel reformed the group in March 2009 with a new line-up, and without John Jughead. Ben had released solo albums that were the same just in his name.  John finally settled for T-Shirt money for being an original member of  the band and a royalties for a handful songs he co-wrote, and let Ben play as Screeching Weasel with the hundreds of song lyrics and music has written.

> Former Members include renowned punk rock record producer Mass Giorgini on bass guitar, Dan Panic (born Dan Sullivan) on drums, and Danny Vapid (born Dan Schafer,on guitar or bass, depending on the band's necessity.  Dan is currently fronting The Methadones and formerly of Sludgeworth)

> Members of Screeching Weasel have gone on to form bands such as: The Methadones, The Mopes, Even in Blackouts, and Sweet Black And Blue. 

> Screeching Weasel has also included members of Green Day, Sludgeworth, Common Rider, Squirtgun, and Teen Idols.

> During one of the band's many break-ups, Weasel and Vapid also formed the Riverdales. Additionally, Ben Weasel released a solo record in 2002 entitled Fidatevi.

> In 2004 Ben Weasel rescinded all of the Screeching Weasel and Riverdales masters from Lookout! Records in the wake of long-running financial and personal conflicts. The masters were subsequently licensed to and reissued by Asian Man Records.

> On December 7, 2010, it was announced that Screeching Weasel will release a new album on March 15, 2011, the band's first album in eleven years. The album will be titled First World Manifesto and will be released on Fat Wreck Chords. It will contain 14 new songs and is produced by Mike Kennerty of The All-American Rejects. It was announced that the label will also be releasing the back catalogs of Screeching Weasel, the Riverdales, and Ben Weasel.

> On March 18, 2011, during Screeching Weasel's South by Southwest Festival performance at the Scoot Inn in Austin, Texas, Foster reached from the stage and slapped a female audience member who had spit on him several times.  This sent off a fire storm web frenzy from all of the self -righteous non Screeching Weasel fans.  Ben apologized for his actions, but all of the perfect people who never loose there cool were not satisfied.
 
Ben and his hired band had a falling out.  He found out who his true friends and fans were.  After over a year of spending time with his family and raising a new baby, he released Carnival of Schadenfreude EP in 2011 with huge interest and has resumed his music career again full swing.

**Backstreet Boys**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/257f300760abbc3ac5c7f4bc8dabfb15.png)  

> The Backstreet Boys, or BSB, is a boy band and pop group that rose to popularity in the late 1990s. Since then they have broken music and concert sale records, having sold more than 180 million albums (38 million in the United States.) to make them the highest-selling boy band on record. The group originally consisted of Nick Carter, Howard Dwaine 'Howie' Dorough, Brian Littrell,  Kevin Richardson, and AJ McLean.

> Their debut album, Backstreet Boys, was released in 1996. The album debuted at #1 in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Finland, Austria, and Canada and sold over 38 million copies worldwide (14 million copies in the U.S.) setting a record for the most successful debut album in history. In some countries, they've also released a second album, Backstreet's Back. In May 1999, the Backstreet Boys released the album Millennium, which sold over 1.13 million units in its first week, setting a record for most albums sold in the first week of release. They also held the most sales for an album's second and third weeks. The record dominated the worldwide charts, landing at the #1 spot in 25 countries. The album was certified 11 times platinum by December 1999, making it the fastest selling album in a year. The album went on to sell over 43 million copies worldwide. Released in November 2000, their album Black & Blue, whose 13-song selection features five songs co-written by members of the group, plus two songs written by all five Backstreet Boys, achieved platinum status in over 30 countries and gold certification in 10 regions around the world during its first week of release with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide.  

> In October 2001, the boys released The Hits: Chapter One, a disc of their greatest hits and Drowning, their last single until their return in 2005. After a five-year hiatus, their new single, Incomplete, was released to radio stations on March 28, 2005 and quickly became the #1 most requested song in top markets in both U.S. and overseas. The song was a drastic change from their previous albums, switching to adult contemporary rather than pop. On June 14, 2005, the Backstreet Boys released their comeback album Never Gone, which they spent more than a year recording. It has sold over 13 million copies worldwide. 

> On June 24, 2006, Kevin Richardson left the band on good terms to pursue personal projects. The group said that they won't close the door to Kevin and whenever he wants to go back, he's welcome. The now four have released on October 30th their sixth album, called Unbreakable. On October 30,2007, BSB madness was back in Times Square for the boys. They have proven time and time again in the industry that they are "unbreakable" and the bond they have for their fans is unbreakable. They started touring in February 2008. Their Unbreakable Tour has been a big success!

> Their new album This Is Us released on October 6th, 2009. They worked with Max Martin, OneRepublic singer Ryan Tedder, RedOne, Ne-Yo, Brian Kennedy, Pitbull, Claude Kelly, Jim Jonsin, Eddie Galan, T-Pain, Rami Yacoub, Kristian Lundin, many others on the album.

> On January 26, 2010, they released a second greatest hits album titled, Playlist: The Very Best of the Backstreet Boys and is part of a series of similar Playlist albums issued by Sony Legacy. Read more on Last.fm.

> The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a funk rock band based in Hollywood, California and were formed in 1983, in Los Angeles, California. The band currently consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael "Flea" Balzary (bass) along with a longtime member Chad Smith (drums). Guitarist John Frusciante quietly left the band on good terms in late 2008. On January 2, 2010, Josh Klinghoffer was announced as Frusciante's replacement.

> The band initially formed for a one-off support act for a friend's band, calling themselves Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem. Upon renaming themselves Red Hot Chili Peppers, they played a handful of small club venues in Los Angeles in 1983, before they were signed to EMI Records.

> Current members:

> Vocal: Anthony Kiedis (1983-present).
Guitar: Josh Klinghoffer (2009-present).
Bass: Michael Peter "Flea" Balzary (1983-present).
Drums: Chad Smith, (1988-present).

Jack Sherman (1984),
Hillel Slovak (1985-1988),
John Frusciante (1988-1992), 
Arik Marshall (1992-1993),

Chad Smith, (1988-present)

> The Red Hot Chili Peppers' original founder and guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, "What Is This?" Upon Slovak's return, Sherman was fired from the band. 

> Slovak did not actually appear on the self-titled debut album, despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by Jack Sherman for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, Freaky Styley. The third album, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, is in fact the only album to include all four founding members. After this, Slovak overdosed on heroin and was replaced on future albums (Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik  - on which Frusciante provides guitars, One Hot Minute - Navarro,  Californication and By the Way - Frusciante) Frusciante is also on 2006's Stadium Arcadium.

> Following Slovak's death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.

> After the release of 1995's One Hot Minute, Navarro's escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who remained in the band until 2008, when he quietly took his leave on good terms with the other members.

> Frusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band Ataxia came out May 2007, and is titled Automatic Writing II.

> In 2003 Flea played bass on The Mars Volta's album Deloused In The Comatorium. Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005's Frances The Mute. He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta's Amputechture. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on Stadium Arcadium, playing the solo on "Especially In Michigan".

> In 2011, the band released  I'm With You, their tenth studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.

> A new era in the band's history took place due Frusciante's departure in 2009. He was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who had already played shows as a second guitarist with the band during their 2007 tour dates. Read more on Last.fm.

> Megan James and Corin Roddick formed Purity Ring in 2010. They both grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. James played piano and Roddick played drums prior to the band's inception, but neither play them as a primary instrument for Purity Ring. During live shows, Roddick uses a custom built, tree-shaped instrument to drive both live sound and lighting. Additionally, during live appearances both wear clothes custom designed and sewn by James.

> The duo were originally two of several members of the band of GOBBLE GOBBLE (now Born Gold). While on tour with Gobble Gobble, Roddick began experimenting with rnb and hip hop beats. James was asked to sing on a track called "Ungirthed," thus forming Purity Ring. The song was released in January 2011.

> On April 3, 2012, Purity Ring announced that they were signed by media company 4AD world-wide and Last Gang Records in Canada. Later in the same month the band announced their debut album, Shrines, set to be released July 24, 2012.  They also debuted the first single from the album titled "Obedear." On June 20, 2012, Purity Ring released another single from the album titled "Fineshrine."  The album reached number 100 on the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it reached number thirty-two on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Dance/Electronic Albums. Read more on Last.fm.

Good quality material is PRECISELY what I'm trying to get at in this post. But thanks.
You should watch Radiohead's Live From the Basement videos for the albums In Rainbows and The King if Limbs. 

Van Morrison is a great live performer. Watch Caravan live. 

Nick Cave is a great performer. Watch Stagger Lee live at Glastonbury 2013 (?).

One of my favorite live videos is Tom Waits performing Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis. 

Finally, I'm a huge Smiths fan, and they usually killed it live.
I have been a big fan since the album city of evil came out. I asked this on your Facebook post for this but next Tuesday is my 24th birthday and I was wondering for my birthday if I can get an autographed picture signed by all of you? It would mean so much to me to get an autograph from you guys for my birthday. I went to the Hail to the King tour back in 2013 and I was in the front and I had caught synister's guitar pick. That will be a day that I will remember forever but what would make it so much better is getting an autograph or actually being able to meet you guys in person.

> Jonathan Mortimer Smith (born January 27, 1971 in Atlanta, Georgia), better known by his stage name Lil Jon, is an American rapper, actor, producer and member of the crunk group Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz. Lil Jon formed the group with friends Big Sam and Lil Bo, and they released five studio albums and have had many hit songs. He's prehaps best known for his iconic single "Get Low", which featured the Ying Yang Twins and reached #2 on the Billboard 100. He released his debut solo album, 'Crunk Rock', in June 2010.

> Lil Jon has also produced many hit urban singles and has made the terms "OK!", "What?!", and "Yeah!" a familiar calling among his friends and followers both inside and outside of the hip-hop genre. He's provided guest verses in many hip-hop and rnb tracks by a wide variety of artists as well. In terms of his personal life, he married Nicole Smith in 2004. They have a son named Nathan, who was born in 1998.

> Lil Jon was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. He worked for So So Def Recordings between 1993 and 2000.

> In addition to leading Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz, Lil Jon has also produced many hit urban singles. From 2003 to 2005, while still with The East Side Boyz, Lil Jon produced hits like "Salt Shaker" by Ying Yang Twins, "Yeah!" by Usher, Freek-a-Leek by Petey Pablo, Shorty Wanna Ride by Young Buck, Shake That Monkey by Too $hort, Let's Go by Trick Daddy, and Girlfight by Brooke Valentine. Lil Jon entered the San Francisco Bay Area hyphy music scene in 2006 with his collaborations with Bay Area rapper E-40, Lil Jon produced E-40's single "Tell Me When To Go" and had E-40 and Atlanta rapper Sean P on his own "Snap Yo Fingers".

> In 2006, Lil' Jon severed his negotiation with record label TVT. He vowed never to record for TVT Records again, alleging that TVT owner Steve Gottlieb was shortchanging him. He also began recording a rock music album, Crunk Rock; in May 2006 he began recording in Las Vegas, Nevada because rock band The Killers was recording its upcoming album Sam's Town there.

> MTV News reported in March 2008 that Crunk Rock was taking more time to complete than Lil' Jon already planned. As part of TVT Records' 2008 bankruptcy auction, Lil' Jon withdrew his multi-million dollar objection to the TVT sale proceedings and agreed to TVTâs transfer of his artist agreement to The Orchard. In return, The Orchard released Lil' Jon from all future obligations and returned the rights to the master recordings of Crunk Rock.

**Less Than Jake**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/f3f33715174c4c0fab77f9d7dad909d3.png)  

> Less Than Jake is a ska-punk band formed in 1992 in Gainesville, Florida. . Their current line-up consists of Chris DeMakes (vocals, guitar), Roger Lima (vocals, bass), Vinnie Fiorello (drums, lyrics), Buddy Schaub (trombone) and Peter "JR" Wasilewski (saxophone).

> The band's name derives from a bird Vinnie had while growing up, which was treated better than the rest of the family. It's also a reference to the phrase "everything is jake," which is an old phrase meaning everything is cool.

> Less Than Jake released their debut album, Pezcore, in 1995, following a series of independent seven-inch single releases. The band's subsequent two studio albums, Losing Streak (1996) and Hello Rockview (1998), were released on major label, Capitol Records, leading to increased exposure. The band's fifth studio album Anthem (2003) was their most commercially successful to date, featuring the singles, "She's Gonna Break Soon" and "The Science of Selling Yourself Short".

> In 2008 the band founded its own label, Sleep It Off Records, and released its seventh full-length album, GNV FLA. The band has recently stated its preference for EP releases, and independently issued Greetings from Less Than Jake (2011) and its counterpart, Seasons Greetings from Less Than Jake (2012). In late 2012, the band combined the two to create the compilation album, Greetings and Salutations (2012) Their eighth studio album, See the Light, was released on November 12, 2013.

> 
Miscellaneous Info:

> Vinnie was previously the owner of the independent record label Fueled by Ramen, as well as a toy company called WÃ¼nderland War (formerly Monkey Vs. Robot). This label has signed bands such as Fall Out Boy, Punchline, The AKAs, Gym Class Heroes, Panic! At The Disco and Days Away. Roger, meanwhile, is in a second band, called Rehasher, for whom he composes lyrics and plays guitar. JR played sax on the last track of Off Key Melodies. JR works with a promoting company called the CT Mafia, as well as composing solo music. He contributed one track to the Drive-Thru compilation tribute to Bob Dylan, using the band name The Stay At Home Joneses (Roger sang backup for this track).

> Roger and Vinnie have an unexplained fetish for Pez candy and they reportedly have sizeable dispenser collections. This love for Pez goes so far as to name one of their albums, Pezcore (parodying of the way in which many bands are described as [something]-core, starting with hardcore) and Pez dispenser motifs are a common feature of their merchandise.

> Roger's employment history includes a smoke shop in the band's hometown Gainesville, Florida known as Knuckleheads which has since been transformed into a similar establishment named Smoke. Band member haunts have included Eddie C's, the Hardback (which was transformed into the Lyric), and Insomnia (which used to be the Covered Dish, and is now the new location of Common Grounds).

> The members of Less Than Jake also served as backup musicians for Asian Man Records owner Mike Park in the B.Lee Band (once called "the Bruce Lee Band", changed for legal reasons).

> The track "Look What Happened" appeared on two of their albums, "Borders & Boundaries" (2000) and "Anthem." (2003) The "Anthem" version is completely re-recorded, and has eschewed the brass at the beginning of the song that was featured in the previous recording. The re-recording features guest vocals from Teen Idols/Bullets To Broadway's Heather.

> They have also re-recorded many other songs, including "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts," "Jen Doesn't Like Me Anymore" and "Shotgun".

> They recorded the main theme song "We're all Dudes" for the 1997 film "Goodburger" based on the sketch from the Nikelodeon TV show "All That."  The song features Kel Mitchell (main character, Ed, in the movie).  The song is based off of the jingle "Ed" would always sing while waiting for the next situation to come up in the Goodburger sketches.  At the end of the song Mitchell says "Ah, Ed and Less than Jake, oh, uh... no?"

> In 2004, Less Than Jake appeared on the Projekt Revolution Tour, joining such artists as The Used, Snoop Dogg, Korn, and the headlining band: Linkin Park.

> Lineups:

>     Chris DeMakes - vocals and guitar (1992âpresent)
    Vinnie Fiorello - drums (1992âpresent)
    Roger Lima - vocals and bass (1993âpresent)
    Buddy ''Goldfinger'' Schaub - tenor trombone and backing vocals (1993âpresent)
    Peter ''JR'' Wasilewski - tenor saxophone and backing vocals (2000âpresent)

> Past members:

>     Jessica Mills - alto saxophone (1993â1998)
    Derron Nuhfer - tenor and baritone saxophone (1995â2000)
    Pete Anna - tenor and alto trombone (1998â2001)

It depends on where you're coming from, musically. People coming from a rock background would appreciate stuff with more "edge," I'd guess. For example:

Miles Davis - "Agharta"

Miles Davis - "On the Corner"

Joe McPhee - "Nation Time"

Dave Holland Quartet - "Extended Play: Live at Birdland"

People coming from a noisier background (i.e., Sonic Youth) would probably like, well, noisier stuff.

John Coltrane - "The Olatunji Concert"

Pharoah Sanders - "Karma"

Sonny Sharrock - "Ask the Ages"

But if you wanna go the straight route, you can't go wrong with the stuff listed above. I'd also recommend the following:

Eric Dolphy - "Out to Lunch"

Andrew Hill - "Point of Departure"

Anthony Braxton - "Dortmund (Quartet) 1976"

Charles Mingus - "Presents Charles Mingus"
Root zoot riot

> The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film "The Goonies" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's "Costello Music",2008's "Here We Stand" and 2013's "We Need Medicine".

> History

> 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

> They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

> The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks "Creepin' Up The Backstairs", "Stacie Anne" and "The Gutterati?". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them "the best new band in Britain". "Creepin' Up The Backstairs" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was "Henrietta", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

> 2006-2007: Costello Music

> Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

> The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including "All Along the Watchtower" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and "Solid Gold Easy Action" for the soundtrack of the film "Hot Fuzz", which also included the single "Baby Fratelli"

> On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD "Edgy In Brixton" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival.

About eight new songs from their new album were played, including "Mistress Mabel", "Acid Jazz Singer", and "Look Out Sunshine!". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster.

> The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles.

**Thrice**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/e6e1ccce71094eab863ef130ce08126d.png)  

> Thrice is an American post-hardcore/experimental rock band that formed in Irvine, California in 1998. The lineup consists of Dustin Kensrue (vocals and guitar), Teppei Teranishi (guitar, keys), Eddie Breckenridge (bass), and Riley Breckenridge (drums).

> In 2000, Thrice signed with Sub City Records and released two LP's. The first, Identity Crisis (2000), only received 1.5 stars in the AMG review and little buzz. The second, The Illusion of Safety (2002), was widely acclaimed and received attention from major record labels. Even though Thrice's music has always included some metal influences, The Illusion of Safety contained a heavier metalcore sound. The album was recorded in Beltsville, Maryland and the track The Beltsville Crucible reflects this.

> In 2003 Thrice signed up with Island Records and released The Artist in the Ambulance, which featured more structured songs while keeping true to their hardcore influences. In 2005 a DVD outlining their entire career to date was released under the title If We Could Only See Us Now. It included a CD with live tracks from the Apple Store and various b-sides.

> Thrice released their fourth full-length album, Vheissu, on October 18, 2005. The album was characterized by many critics as being experimentally different, using non-traditional Thrice elements in the process. From keyboard melodies ("For Miles") to Japanese music-box undertones ("Music Box") to chain gang chant choruses ("The Earth Will Shake"), Vheissu introduced a new sound to the band's post-hardcore roots. UK producer Steve Osborne, whose past credits include many Brit-pop hits, was sought by Thrice to gain a new perspective on the songwriting process, enabling the band to expand their musical influences and produce a different album. The album garnered widespread critical acclaim and peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200.

> The band releasedRed Sky, an EP comprised of various b-sides as well as live recordings, shortly after Vheissu.

> Thrice released the first and second volume of The Alchemy Index, a highly experimental project based on the four traditional elements (fire, water, earth, and air), on October 16th 2007.  Over the summer Thrice parted ways with Island records and signed with Vagrant.  The Alchemy Index Vols. I & II - Fire & Water was released on October 16, 2007, and sold 28,000 copies in its first week. The album consists of the first two volumes, Fire and Water, and features 12 songs, 6 on each disk.  The third and fourth volumes, Air & Earth were released on April 15, 2008.

> The "Fire" disc features the heavier post-hardcore sound traditional Thrice fans will quickly embrace, harking back to their pre-Vheissu albums. The "Water" disc, however, is comprised of ambient songs similar to those found in Vheissu, Thrice's previous album release.  The "Air" disc brings a whole new element of electronic elements and delayed guitar riffs to Thrice's sound. In "Earth", much like Dustin Kensrue's solo album, "Please Come Home", Thrice introduces an indie-folk sound combining intricate piano and acoustic homo guitar.

> Thrice's sixth studio album Beggars was released digitally through Vagrant Records in the UK on August 9, 2009 and in the US on August 11 with a physical release containing bonus material pencilled in for September 15. These dates deviate from the original proposed release date of October 13 because of a leak via Vagrant Records web player, which has meant the artwork for the album has also changed. The first single to be taken from the album is All the World Is Mad and was first made available through Guitar Hero: World Tour on July 23.

> Dustin Kensrue has described the album as being "more visceral and more raw - both in the songwriting and in the overall sound. It moves with a different energy than any of our past records. It was born out of us playing together in a room, almost as a backlash to the giant headgame that was The Alchemy Index" and has been well received critically. 

> The seventh studio album Major/Minor came out on September 20, 2011  through Vagrant Records. Yellow Belly,  Promises and a few other songs were made available for the listeners to stream online before the release date. The album received extremely positive reviews from many online websites. Alex Djaferis of Absolutepunk.net gave Major/Minor a rating of 95%. Tracks like Promises and Listen Through Me reflected a natural progression from the sound Thrice created in Beggars, which was widely appreciated by the early listeners. 

> Thrice decided to take a break from being a full time band on November 21, 2011. In late spring/early summer Thrice announced the 'Farewell' tour for the spring/summer of 2012 , which would be the bands final tour before going into an indefinite hiatus.

> In early 2015 it was announced that the band intends to release new music and tour again. Announcements were done via the bands website http://www.thrice.net/ and social media outlets with an accompanying picture with "Thrice 2015" text. Read more on Last.fm.

If you only have a problem with 2.5 genres, then don't make a sweeping generalization about all modern music. What modern music do you like? 

EDIT: I thought you said your issues were with those three genres, but you said that's your main music. Well, yeah, autotune is pretty standard fare for that music. I don't think autotune's inherently bad or soulless, but if you do, then you should maybe start looking into other modern genres or subgenres.
Any Erroll Garner fans here? Just curious.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/96459229ba8f42fdb8df489bfb80176c.png)  

> The Shins are an American indie rock band centered around James Mercer.

> The band formed in 1997, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States as a side project of Mercer (previously of Blue Roof Dinner) and drummer Jesse Sandoval, who were both members of Flake Music. The band's original lineup was Mercer (vocals, guitar), Sandoval (drums), Marty Crandall (keyboards) and Dave Hernandez (bass). Neil Langford replaced Hernandez in 1998. Hernandez returned to the band in 2003, as Langford had left the band in 2001. Hernandez remained in the band until 2009. Fruit Bats keyboardist Eric Johnson joined the band in 2006.

> Their debut album, Oh, Inverted World was issued in 2001 and contained the singles "New Slang" and "Caring is Creepy", which were both featured in the 2004 film "Garden State". The band's next album, Chutes Too Narrow was released in 2003 and featured the single "So Says I".  The band's third album Wincing The Night Away, was released in 2007 and debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 charts, the highest charting album in Sub Pop history until Arcade Fire's"The Suburbs" debuted at #1. After a short hiatus, Mercer announced in 2009 that the band was to record a new album and that Marty Crandall, and Jesse Sandoval were no longer members of The Shins. The band's new lineup included James Mercer, Eric Johnson, Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer and Grand Archives keyboardist Ron Lewis.

> Before the release of Port of Morrow, the band lineup changed once more with only Mercer and Plummer remaining from the previously announced lineup. The newly added members were announced as guitarist Jessica Dobson, bassist Yuuki Matthews (formerly of Crystal Skulls) and keyboardist Richard Swift.

> The Simple Song Songfacts reports that "Simple Song." was the first single from the Port Of Morrow album, the band's debut release on James Mercer's Aural Apothecary record label. It was also the first offering to be heard from the band following the departure of Jesse Sandoval and Marty Crandall.

> The current line-up for the live act is James Mercer (vocals, guitar), Jessica Dobson (guitar), Yuuki Matthews (bass), Richard Swift (keyboards) and Joe Plummer (drums).

**Citizen Cope**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/a28603551c7843f49472e5d73bdbae38.png)  

> Citizen Cope is a pseudonym of Clarence Greenwood, keyboardist, guitarist, singer, DJ, and record producer. Citizen Cope now lives in Brooklyn, New York.

> Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Greenwood started his musical career as a DJ for the hip hop act Basehead, a group that would have a significant impact on his style as a solo-musician. Citizen Cope blends many genres of music, such as folk, blues, hip hop, rock, and R & B.

> Greenwood first released a demo tape under the name Cope Citizen in the late '90s. He would follow up the release of the demo by donating songs to several independently issued compilations, movie soundtracks, as well as appearing on several fellow artist's albums.

> In 2000 Greenwood signed with the DreamWorks Records label, which released his first album in September 2002, Citizen Cope. Greenwood toured to promote the record as an opener for Nelly Furtado. He performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, in 2002.

> After the release of Citizen Cope, Greenwood felt the label "mishandled" the record, creating tension between the two. The tension prompted Greenwood to buy out his contract with the label, using the advance he received from his next label, Arista Records and RCA Records, to do so.

> In September of 2004, Citizen Cope released his second record, The Clarence Greenwood Recordings, which earned him much critical success as well as minor touring success as an opening act for a popular touring band, Robert Randolph & the Family Band.

> In 2005, Cope continued to tour the United States promoting his second major label record. In April, his song "Son's Gonna Rise" began appearing in a Pontiac commercial and was distributed as the album's second single.

> The song "Bullet and a Target" was played in the end credits of the 2006 film The Sentinel, during a scene of the 2007 movie Alpha Dog, and also during a scene in the ski film Tangerine Dream.
The song "Let The Drummer Kick" was featured in the film Accepted and Coach Carter.  It was also featured on the HBO series Entourage during the fourth season finale "The Cannes Kids."  Entourage also featured the song "Awe" during the second part of the third season's (3B) episode "The Prince's Bride".The song "Son's Gonna Rise" was featured in the television series, One Tree Hill. The song "Sideways" was featured in the television series Scrubs.

No, you made a blanket statement that sampling is theft. And is it not creative to interpolate or chop up samples to fit something you made yourself? You seem to have pretty weird definitions of creativity, talent, and mimicry.

Probably the most effortless use of complex time meters ever recorded.  Take 5 was a commercial cross over hit, no easy feat for odd time signatures.  Only Money by Fink Floyd comes to mind as equally popular.   Brubeck doesn't get much love from the hard boppers but i love it.
I like Kanye.  My question is what did he do that makes him so much better than his peers.

He used to be a respected fire-flame gourmet chef in New York City, but gave up cooking for a rap career and still frequently raps about food in his songs. He initially gained notoriety lyrically and stylistically resembling to rapper Ghostface Killah (whom he collaborated with, along with friend, and fellow rapper Termanology on a song called "Meteor Hammer" on Wu-Tang Clan's 2011 album Legendary Weapons). In an interview with HipHopDX, he was asked about how it was to sound like him, and he responded with,

To me there is no comparison; he is a legend and I am a newcomer. If I would try and emulate with anyone it would be Kool G Rap, he is the person I look up to the most.

I just wish this man was alive.... RIP Jay, can't hold your death
I don't hate him.  But I also don't understand why he's considered more of a genius than someone like Eminem.

Here's a pretty good video about one of the things that make Kanye such a unique artist in the hip-hop world. It's also important to understand that sampling is a huge part of hip-hop culture and it is much more than just a "rip-off" of someone else's work.
This is my all time favorite jazz tune. The whole album is great but this song is so timeless. I especially love listening to it while driving - somehow it makes me feel like I'm in a car commercial even if I'm just driving errands. The live versions are much faster tempo and just kick ass. 

Also, I love that Brubeck loved to mess with different time signatures. The first song I ever heard of his was [unsquare dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yExwkQYcp0) which I think is in 7/4 time. 7/4 time - thats crazy talk! I had a friend that loved it so much he had a tape of just that song played on repeat (this was before CD burners were cheap).

Dave you were a mad man and I love you for it!

> Having founded seminal Memphis punk outfit Reatards at the tender age of sixteen, Jay Reatard (May 1, 1980 - January 13, 2010) was a seasoned veteran of the garage-punk scene. In the '90s Reatards turned the Memphis underground rock scene upside down with a legendary live show so over-the-top that they were banned in a number of European countries.

> Never content to stick to one genre, one project or one band, Jay also co-led the synth-punk Lost Sounds with Alicja Trout, played drums for The Final Solutions, pursued the solo project Terror Visions, co-fronted The Angry Angles and ran his own label, Shattered Records. 

> In 2006, In The Red announced the release of Blood Visions, Jay's first album as a solo artist, which combined the aggressive approach of Reatards with a melodic pop sensibility, and production recalling classic UK punk records -- The Adverts (who he covered), Siouxsie & the Banshees, ATV, etc.

> On January 13, 2010, Jay was found dead at the age of 29 at his home in Memphis.  A statement was posted on the website of Goner Records that Reatard had died in his sleep.  His autopsy reported he died of cocaine toxicity and alcohol as a contributing factor.

**Ween**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/d6e775c719b14f839191e6a3deba48c6.png)  

> Ween is an experimental rock group formed in 1984 in New Hope, Pennsylvania, United States when Aaron Freeman (Gene Ween) and Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween) met in an eighth grade typing class. Ween collected a large underground fanbase despite being generally unknown in mainstream music circles aside from their 1992 fluke hit âPush th' Little Daisiesâ. 

> The band's style is eclectic, and while they could generally be referred to as rock, one of their defining tendencies has been experimentation with various styles incorporating a strong element of humor and absurdity. Both Gene and Dean are skilled multi-instrumentalists who overdubbed various instruments on their recordings, though they also record with the regular touring band.

> Their earliest home recordings were anarchic and free-spirited, drawing on influences as far-reaching as Beatles, Queen, Prince, Butthole Surfers, The Residents and the lo-fi punk movement. Ween was often compared in their early years to other offbeat artists such as Frank Zappa and would always eschew such comparisons.

> Ween was signed to Twin/Tone Records in 1989 and released their first album GodWeenSatan: The Oneness in the following year, a 26-track smorgasbord of wild eclecticism. 1991's The Pod became a fast fan favorite, as the duo's use of drum machines, pitch-tweaked guitars & vocals and drug-laced humor became a trademark part of their sound. The Pod, according to Ween-lore, was written under the influence of Scotchgard, but this was later refuted by Gene and Dean themselves as being "the most slime-bag thing we could think of." The contraption on the album cover is not a Scotchgard inhalation device, but a bong-like device used to send marijuana directly to the brain by use of nitrous oxide, which was said to leave the user intoxicated for days, but nauseated. The cover of The Pod used the cover of the 1975 Leonard Cohen album, The Best of Leonard Cohen, but with the head of Mean Ween (aka Chris "Cribber" Williams, a friend of the band) wearing the mask, pasted onto that of Cohen.

> Pure Guava, the first of a series of releases on the Elektra label, featured their highest charting single, "Push Th' Little Daisies" (1992) which gained them media & MTV attention, as the video was a highlighted target on MTV's Beavis & Butt-head. Chocolate and Cheese followed in 1994, heralding 70s pop/rock & soul sendups such as "Freedom of '76" and "Voodoo Lady". The "Freedom of '76" music video was directed by Spike Jonze. At this time, Ween began to expand their live and studio line-up, providing both a crisper production sound in the studio and an easier live setup (up until this time, Ween had been using DAT tapes to provide backings for their songs).

> Ween turned to Nashville studio musicians for the recording of the authentically-spirited 12 Golden Country Greats (1996) which only contained ten tracks. There are two theories regarding the title of the album. The first is that it refers to the dozen veteran Nashville studio musicians who played on the album. The second is that the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album, but upon the removal of the tracks "I Got No Darkside" and "So Long, Jerry" (the latter of which was a B-side on the "Piss Up A Rope" single) they decided not to rename it.

> The nautically-themed The Mollusk followed in 1997, demonstrating Ween's satirization, deconstruction, and appreciative mastery of genres including 1960's Brit-pop, sea shanties, Broadway show tunes, and especially progressive rock. Their desire to pursue alternate forms of media led to the MP3-only release Craters of the Sac (1999), presented by Dean for online download and free trade. Elektra Records released a live compilation entitled Paintin' The Town Brown: Ween Live 1990-1998 in 1999, followed by White Pepper (2000), their pop-themed album and final studio set for Elektra. The track "Even If You Don't" was made into a music video directed by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Shortly after White Pepper Ween started the internet radiostation WeenRadio, which was awarded 3rd best internet music site by Rolling Stone.[1]

> Ween also formed their own label at this time, Chocodog Records, which oversaw the release of several self-produced live sets. The aforementioned Paintin' the Town Brown, which was compiled and mastered by the band, was meant to be the first Chocodog release. According to Dean Ween, once the album was completed, Elektra realized the sales potential of the CD and denied Ween the right to release it through Chocodog. Later, Ween released the first official Chocodog album, Live in Toronto (a live recording from the 1996 tour, in which Ween performed with Bobby Ogdin & The Shit Creek Boys). The limited-pressing CD, available exclusively through the band website, became an instant collector's item. Subsequent Chocodog releases (Live at Stubb's and All Request Live) were produced in higher volumes to meet demand. In 2005, the label released the first instalment of a rarity compilation series entitled Shinola, and announced plans to re-release the 1987 cassette tape by Gene, Synthetic Socks.

> The two signed to Sanctuary Records in 2003 and released Quebec, their first studio set in 3 years. In 2004, they released Live in Chicago, a DVD and CD set that compiled tracks from three energetic live performances.

> In February of 2006, they rented an old farmhouse and converted it into a working studio. After writing over 50 songs and recording rough versions through 2006, they picked through them, and, with Andrew Weiss as producer, re-recorded album versions.

You answered your own question, genius. Permission/payment. But a rip-off is still a rip-off. No creativity or talent there. Just mimicry.
Thank you, that was excellent. Drum solo is so much better live.

Most underappreciated song in the Lion King. People know the others, but glance over this one which is a shame
In regards to your first three sentences I think that stuff applies mainly to the more trendy/popular stuff that's played on the radio. If you spend some more time looking into other modern bands/artists you will find that there are plenty that produce music with "soul" and "meaning". You just haven't discovered their music yet. The "procedurally generated rubbish" is the most accessible and catchy type of music hence why it becomes so popular with people. The more popular it is=the more you will come across fans of the music.

Oh fuck. I never knew that "The shape of punk to come" by Refused was in reference to this.
lol I love Reddit
You literally just described all music and art ever. Nothing is made in a vacuum. 

Secondly he's considered a genius because he tends to set trend and has no problem doing weird shit like rap over a old daft punk song.
Yes! Thank you
Mine as well. A more contemporary artist that's one of my all time saxophonists is Chris Potter. You've gotta listen to him take giant steps acapella. It's ridiculous how dexterous that guy is.
Damn it's been a while since I got rolled, and this one was unexpected as well. Kudos to you
Lol, have an upvote
I hate the guy also, but can't deny he has talent. His work is so good it's hard to hate it. Say what you want to say about the guy but he's great at what he does.
It's /r/music, you can't expect anything less in a Kanye thread.
Hi ,Just want to say that my 14 year old son introduced me to A7X about 6 months ago .  I am so hooked I listen everyday .Can't get enough . I was wondering if y'all are planning on coming to Alabama in the near future . I would love to see you live .Love,Love,Love  THE Stage . I have had to listen a few times to take it all in with the video . Hope to see you soon .
You're welcome, and it's great you'll be taking a piano course.  I think you'll be happy with any of those.
Simply put, he knows what sounds good and what doesnt. He doesnt play a classical instrument (that i know of) but he will have a sound he wants and finds the correct people to deliver like a composer would. Specifically in Hip-Hop he creates new trends and styles of sounds that pave the way for other artist to experiment with. Everyone ripped his 808 and Heartbreaks drum kits, and style wise broke ground for people like Drake, Kid Cudi, the Weeknd, etc. 
     Its very easy to say that he "rips off other artists" just to hate, but how are "Harder, Better, Faster" and "Stronger" similar besides him using the hook? I laugh when people stay he "ruined" that song when they sound nothing alike. part of the art of sampling is transforming it and making it different. I actually enjoy going through the samples he uses and hearing them in their original form to see the "then/now". Sometimes it is untouched or minimally changed like in his "freestyle 4" he used Goldfrapp's "Human" but those are far and few in between.
     Lyrically he's not very strong, but there are still messages in a lot of his songs and signs that he is socially conscience("All falls down", "Jesus Walks", Through the Wire", "Roses", "Hey Mama"). obviously more so in his beginning projects, but there are still songs between his "commercial rap" songs that he makes today("Black Skinhead", "New Slaves"). As much as talk about his Ego he has plenty of songs that show his vulnerable side or show that he's human("Runaway", "Blame Game"), and plenty of other songs that show the many sides of Kanye, good or bad.
**Dinosaur Jr.**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9295c6f5953d4bd8cb2406fc2821c68c.png)  

> Dinosaur Jr. is a rock band which formed in 1983 in Amherst, Massachusetts. The band was formed by J Mascis (guitar and vocals) and his high school classmate Lou Barlow (bass guitar), following the break-up of their hardcore punk band Deep Wound. Shortly afterwards, Murph (Emmett Patrick Murphy, drums) joined them. 

> The band was originally called "Dinosaur", but changed its name following the release of its debut album Dinosaur in 1985, after a band called Dinosaurs, featuring ex-members of Country Joe and the Fish and Jefferson Airplane, threatened them with legal action. (They still used the name Dinosaur on their albums until 1987 at the latest, and some copies of You're Living All Over Me still lack the "Jr").

> In 1987, Dinosaur Jr. signed to SST Records on the recommendation of Sonic Youth, and with them released what is often considered their best album, You're Living All Over Me. Bug followed the next year, an album which, in the UK, was released by Paul Smith's Blast First Records (home to Sonic Youth, Big Black and Butthole Surfers). During this period Dinosaur Jr. became known for their very loud concerts. 

> Despite not gaining much commercial success, the band has enjoyed something of a cult following. The success of singles Freak Scene and Just Like Heaven, and recommendations from the likes of Sonic Youth saw them signed by Warner Brothers. The signature Dinosaur Jr. sound is the melodic tunes saturated in layers of guitar noise and punctuated by J Mascis' elaborate, yet laconic guitar solos.  They were a major influence on the up-and-coming band Nirvana.

> Tensions ran high between Mascis and Barlow, and in 1989 Barlow was kicked out of the band.  As a result, Barlow continued  to work with his own band, Sebadoh. The two famously fell out on stage with Mascis attacking Barlow. Dinosaur Jr. subsequently became little more than a pseudonym for Mascis. He switched labels to Blanco y Negro in the UK, Warner/Sire in the US, with Green Mind (1991) being his first release in that deal.

> After Barlow left the band, Van Conner, from the Screaming Trees, played bass for at least one live show in 1990, and Donna Dresch, from Team Dresch played bass at least once live with the band in 1990.

> In 1991, Mike Johnson joined Dinosaur Jr as full-time bass player. He was in the band for 1991's Whatever's Cool With Me, 1993's Where You Been, 1994's Without A Sound, and 1997's Hand It Over. 

> Murph left the band in late 1993, after the Lollapalooza tour.

> George Berz took over on drums, and drummed from 1994-1997. He was on Without A Sound, and Hand It Over. He later drummed for J Mascis + the Fog in 2000, 2001, and 2003.

> Through the 90s, Mascis sometimes explored quieter and more tranquil shores than Dinosaur Jr. had in the 80s. The band formed part of the 1992 "Rollercoaster" tour. A package tour based on the successful "Lollapalooza". The tour featured The Jesus & Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine & Blur. On the 1993 release, Where You Been, the opening track ("Out There") had an accompanying video and was aired on MTV for a short time. After 1994's Without a Sound and 1997's Hand It Over, Mascis began to release albums with the band J Mascis and the Fog.

> In 2004, J Mascis regained the master rights to the first three Dinosaur Jr. albums from SST, and arranged for their reissue on the Merge label in early 2005. The reissues coincided with an announcement that the original lineup of  J Mascis, Lou Barlow and Murph (Emmett Patrick Murphy) were reuniting for a summer tour. The success of this tour resulted in a new album entitled Beyond (2007) and single Been There All The Time. They are Lou Barlow's first recording with the band since 1989. The original line-up of Dinosaur Jr. has been touring extensively since 2005. They are currently on a world tour.

> On February 20, 2009, Pitchfork Media announced that the band had signed with indie label Jagjaguwar, and their first release on the label entitled Farm was released June 23, 2009, to largely positive reviews.

**Steely Dan**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/f6a045f3fd7b4b7cba3924e4dd9ce055.png)  

> Steely Dan is an American jazz rock band which formed in 1972. The band was formed by Donald Fagen (vocals, keyboards) and Walter Becker (guitar, bass), who met in 1967 while both attended Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and began a songwriting partnership shortly thereafter.

> Their music is characterized by dark, witty lyrical narratives, obscure lyrical allusions and complex, jazz-influenced instrumentation and chord sequences, overlying more ordinary popular song structures. Their fastidious standards in the studio and use of world-class sessions players has also been a hallmark of their work. For this, special credit should be given to their long-time producer Gary Katz and engineer Roger Nichols.  

> The band was originally a six-piece consisting of Fagen, Becker, David Palmer (vocals), Jeff "Skunk" Baxter (guitar), Denny Dias (guitar) and Jim Hodder (drums), but by 1975, only Fagen and Becker remained.

> The band's history can be divided into three stages. In its original conception, the group was a relatively conventional rock band that toured from 1972 to 1974, releasing the singles-chart successes, 'Do It Again', 'Reelin' in the Years', 'My Old School' and 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number'. The group's name was derived from a series of dildos in the 1959 novel, 'Naked Lunch' by the avant-garde writer, William S. Burroughs; the phrase first used in the lyrics of an early, pre-Steely Dan Fagen/Becker song, Soul Ram.

> In its second stage (1975 - 1980) the group, now consisting solely of Fagen and Becker, became a purely studio-based act, their album releases showing a growing obsession with polished production values, and whose output became increasingly jazz-orientated, culminating in the highly successful 'Aja' (1977) and 'Gaucho' (1980). The two split in 1981 following a tumultuous recording process for the latter album, and personal problems for both members.

> In the Eighties, Fagen released his seminal debut album, 'The Nightfly', and took time away from the music industry, whilst Becker, after recovering from drug dependence, was in frequent work as a producer.

> The third stage came when Fagen and Becker reunited in 1993, followed by a world tour (their first touring dates in 20 years). In 2000, the Grammy-award-winning 'Two Against Nature' was released to critical and surprising commercial success. Its successor followed swiftly, 'Everything Must Go' being released in 2003. The two albums show a more relaxed attitude to production, less morbid lyrical themes and an upbeat jazz pop sound, but  with the characteristic wit and musical complexity of their 20th century work remaining. Fagen and Becker continue to tour as Steely Dan and release albums independently.

Lol then tell me why people who sample with permission/payment aren't getting sued? You have no idea how the music industry works.
No it's not.
Released in 1960, recorded in late 59'

I'd say he at least "re-invented" sampling. Hugely influential to modern music for
better or worse.
That ego was always there, and you apparently have no fucking clue where or how hip-hop began.
I'm probably envisioning the "right time", as OP mentioned, to be something more akin to on stage at a performance-based event rather than around the campfire with your mates late at night.

He actually stole his career and style from a guy named Saul Williams, and uses sampling to cover his lack of talent.

Don't expect to get any backup for your opinion though, a bunch of sad teenies on this sub (who were toddlers back when Kanye was saying dumbass shit on the regular, and embarrassing himself and others at the Grammy's) think his biting and stealing make him somebody, and shit on anyone who points out what a fraudulent piece of human waste he is.
Fuck You.
[how about this?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chega_de_Saudade) :

>"Chega de Saudade" is often considered to be the first recorded bossa nova song The music was composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim and the lyrics were written by VinÃ­cius de Moraes. JoÃ£o Gilberto's recording is the most famous.

>The title can be translated roughly as "enough longing," though the Portuguese word, [*Saudade*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade), carries with it a far more complex meaning. The word implies an intensity of heartfelt connection that is yearned for passionately, not unlike feeling withdrawal symptoms from a drug that makes one feel good. Another good analogy might be an intense homesickness. Chega, in this case, means no more, enough.

> AntÃ´nio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (born January 25, 1927 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil â December 8, 1994 in New York City), also called Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, arranger, singer, pianist and perhaps the greatest legend of bossa nova. Jobim's compositions, many performed by JoÃ£o Gilberto, gave birth to the genre in the early 1960s.

> Jobim's roots were planted firmly in the works of Pixinguinha, a legendary musician and composer who, in the 1930s, began the development of modern Brazilian music. He was also influenced by the music of French composer Claude Debussy and by jazz.

> Jobim found prominence when he teamed up with writer and poet Vinicius de Moraes in providing part of the music for the play Orfeu de Carnaval (1956), that later gained wide recognition in the film Black Orpheus. The lyrics for his most popular songs were written by de Moraes.

> American jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra prominently featured Jobim's songs on their albums Ella Abraca Jobim (1981) and Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967), respectively. Jobim is recognized the world over as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. His first album, Sinfonia Do Rio De Janeiro, was recorded in 1954, with Billy Blanco.

> Jobim was buried in the CemitÃ©rio SÃ£o JoÃ£o Batista in Rio de Janeiro. The International Airport of Rio de Janeiro is now named in his honor.

**Kim Carnes**

> Kim Carnes (born July 20,1945 in Los Angeles, California) is an American singer-songwriter. She is noted for her distinctive, raspy voice which she attributes to many hours spent singing in smoky bars and clubs.

> Carnes was a member of New Christy Minstrels from  1966 until 1970. Kenny Rogers was also a member, and during this time Carnes met and married Dave Ellingson, with whom she would write most of her songs. For a short while in the early 1970s, she and Ellingson formed the folk duo Kim and Dave, which was not successful. She began releasing albums during the early 1970s. Her self-titled album in 1975 contained her first hit, "You're A Part Of Me," a duet with Gene Cotton (and a cover of a minor hit for Canadian singer Susan Jacks earlier that year) that went to #36 on the charts. This album was followed in 1976 with Sailin'. One track, "Love Comes From Unexpected Places," won best song at the 1977 American Song Festival and gained some additional notice after it was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her 1977 album Streisand Superman.

> In 1980 a duet with Kenny Rogers titled "Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer" became a major hit on the country and western charts and also became a pop hit. Her cover version of the Smokey Robinson & The Miracles song "More Love" became her first solo hit single in 1980 when it reached the U.S. Top 10.

> In 1981 she recorded the Jackie DeShannon and Donna Weiss song "Bette Davis Eyes". As the first single released from the album Mistaken Identity, it spent 9 weeks at number one on the US singles charts and became a worldwide hit. The single went on to become the #1 bestseller for the year and won Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. It is second only to Olivia Newton-John's "Physical" (released later in 1981 and late enough to be the number one single of 1982), which spent 10 weeks at number one, as the biggest hit of the entire decade of the 1980s. In 1986, she recorded "Room Enough For Two," theme to CBS sitcom "My Sister Sam" starring Pam Dawber and the late Rebecca Schaeffer.

> It is ironic that Carnes' best known and most popular song "Bette Davis Eyes" written in 1974 was originally rejected by Carnes. It was only after a new instrumental arrangement was done by Bill Cuomo that Carnes agreed to record it and it became a huge hit. Bette Davis admitted to being a fan of the song and approached Carnes and the songwriters to thank them. Davis wrote to Carnes after the song was released and stated that she was very pleased with the song as it made her seem very up to date with her grandson. She had Carnes sing the song live for her at a tribute held just before her death.

> Carnes continued to record and released several albums into the 1990s. These releases failed to reach the level of success of "Bette Davis Eyes", but by this time she was a highly respected songwriter, and collaborated with such artists as Barbra Streisand. Carnes has written three number one country songs: âThe Heart Wonât Lieâ, a hit duet for Reba McEntire and Vince Gill, âDonât Fall In Love With A Dreamerâ, a huge hit duet she performed with Kenny Rogers, and âMake No Mistake Sheâs Mineâ, a duet performed by Kenny Rogers and Ronnie Milsap. The latter song was originally "Make No Mistake, He's Mine," a No. 51 Pop hit in 1984 for Carnes and Streisand featured on Streisand's album Emotion. Also in 1984, Carnes sang on the No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit "What About Me?" with Rogers and James Ingram.

> Co-writing with others, Carnes has had songs covered by such country stars as Deana Carter, Kevin Sharp, Sawyer Brown, Suzy Bogguss, Pam Tillis and Tanya Tucker. She wrote "You Don't Love Me Anymore," a hit song on Tim McGraw's album A Place In The Sun.

> In 2004, she re-appeared with a self-released album Chasin' Wild Trains.

> In August 2005, her 1981 single âDraw Of The Cardsâ hit #1 on the internet radio request site FreezeFrameRadio.com.

> She currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee.

I had to double-check and, sure enough, it's DaveBrubeckVEVO. What's up with them doing that, if they own the music anyway?
The fucking LCC, man. Had to write on it for my diss. To quote myself quoting someone else:

"... Within [the major scaleâs] seven tones lies the most fundamental harmonic progression of the classical era... the tonic major chord on C... the sub-dominant major chord on F... the dominant seventh chord on G â thus, the major scale resolves to its tonic major chord. The Lydian scale is the sound of its tonic major chord."

This is "original, brilliant, even self-evident, but no-one had quite said it before" (Brubeck, Cambridge Companion to Jazz, 192).
For anyone who likes this, I would also recommend listening to [Take Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI7hArFCiR8). Both songs were composed by Paul Desmond.
To each their own!

I wrote my dissertation on that year, and included Giant Steps (indeed, my title was 1959: Giant Steps in Jazz)!

For a great overview, Dave B's son Darius Brubeck wrote a great chapter on why it's such a pivotal year, in the Cambridge Companion to Music. Well worth checking out.

> Aram Ilyich Khachaturian (Armenian: Ô±ÖÕ¡Õ´ Ô½Õ¡Õ¹Õ¡Õ¿ÖÕµÕ¡Õ¶; Russian: ÐpaÐ¼ ÐÐ»ÑÐ¸Ñ XaÑaÑypÑÐ½; June 6 [O.S. May 24] 1903 â May 1, 1978) was a prominent Soviet Armenian composer. Khachaturian's works were often influenced by classical Russian music and Armenian folk music. He is most famous for the Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia from his ballet Spartacus, and for the "Sabre Dance" from his ballet Gayane and the adagio from the same ballet, much used in films since its first use in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

> In his youth, he was fascinated by the music he heard around him, but at first he did not study music or learn to read it.
In 1921, he traveled to Moscow to join his brother, unable to speak a word of Russian. Although he had almost no musical education, Khachaturian showed such great talent that he was admitted to the Gnessin Institute where he studied cello under Mikhail Gnessin and entered a composition class (1925). In 1929, he transferred to the Moscow Conservatory where he studied under Nikolai Myaskovsky. In the 1930s, he married the composer Nina Makarova, a fellow student from Myaskovsky's class. In 1951, he became professor at the Gnessin State Musical and Pedagogical Institute (Moscow) and the Moscow Conservatory. He also held important posts at the Composers Union.

> Khachaturian wrote music influenced by the folk music of his native Armenia and also composed pieces, such as the Third Symphony, as tributes to Communism. He said, "I wanted to write the kind of composition in which the public would feel my unwritten program without an announcement. I wanted this work to express the Soviet peopleâs joy and pride in their great and mighty country.â He was later denounced by the Communist Party's Central Committee and his colleagues from the Composers Union, led by Andrei Zhdanov, for being too "formalist" and "antipopular."  However these three composers [Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Khatchaturian] later became the so called "titans" of Soviet music, enjoying world-wide reputation as the leading composers of the 20th century.

Don't forget Zappa's "Freak Out"
It might be under John Zorn?
It was actually a high school class. I had the fortune to go to an arts school. The guitar class there was taught by an amazing jazz fusion artist. He actually personally knows guys like Patitucci and Scott Henderson. I believe he knows Frank Gambale as well. Look up Ward Aycock if you get the chance. The class levels went from 1, beginning to 4, masters. My senior year he introduced a higher level 5. It was me and four other people only. The best of the best. I loved that class.
Uhh, weren't most of Ray Charles songs his interpretations of old church hymns? His stuff wasn't always 100% original.
**Machine Head**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/ea617c2f495d45acc5d69f06fbfec823.png)  

> Machine Head is an American male-fronted metal band, formed in 1992 in Oakland, California. Founded by former Vio-lence guitarist Robert Flynn and Adam Duce, and has had 4 personnel changes since its inception. The current lineup of the band comprises of Robb Flynn (vocals, guitar), Jared MacEachern (bass), Phil Demmel (guitar, ex-Vio-lence), and Dave McClain (drums, ex-Sacred Reich). Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.

> The song Davidian of their debut album Burn My Eyes, features the lyrics "Let freedom ring / with a shotgun blast". Subsequently the video was banned from MTV due to its release date being very soon after the Waco Siege which it was apparently describing. Robb Flynn has since said that the song was not written about the Waco Siege but added that line to get people thinking.

> After their debut album Chris Kontos left to work with Testament and a stand in drummer (Chris Konstanza) was used for Machine Head's Donington slot in 1995. After this, the drumming services of Dave McClain were acquired. They then released the follow-up album, The More Things Change in 1997, after which guitarist Logan Mader unexpectedly left in the spring of 1998. He was then replaced by Ahrue Luster (now of Ill NiÃ±o who worked with the band on the third album The Burning Red (1999). This album was a sign of a change for Machine Head, the band deciding to experiment more rather than release another album that would be seen as just a shadow in the footsteps of Burn My Eyes. Robb uses his rapping techniques in this album rather than the growl he used on earlier releases. The song "Devil With The Kings Card" is based on Logan Mader's leaving of the band. The album did, however, receive some backlash from fans who weren't pleased with their change in style - some even accused the band of "selling out" and following musical trends (nu-metal and rap metal were becoming increasingly popular in 1999).

> Although Burn My Eyes was more influential as an album to the metal scene in general, according to a Blabbermouth.net report, The Burning Red moved almost as many units in 3 years (1999-2002) as Burn My Eyes did in 8 years (1994-2002). In 2000, bands like Machine Head and Slipknot were involved in product placement for the HBO show The Sopranos. A.J. Soprano, played by Robert Iler, often wore Roadrunner Records apparel like Machine Head's Year of the Dragon T-Shirt.

> Machine Head released Supercharger in 2001, though the album failed to do well, mostly due to it being released shortly after 9/11. The video for the song "Crashing Around You" was banned by MTV due to its images of a city skyline being over-taken by flames. This of course was not intended, the video was shot before the events of 9/11. The album recevied more of the same criticism that met The Burning Red. Once the tour had been completed, Machine Head left their record label Roadrunner Records. In 2002 Ahrue Luster left the band because of musical differences. Ahrue Luster then joined Il Nino and was replaced by Phil Demmel, who played in thrash band Vio-lence alongside Flynn.

> Since then, 2003 and 2004 were somewhat of a revival for Machine Head, firstly releasing their live album Hellalive in 2003 which was a recording of their set at Brixton Academy, London on December 4th.

> In Fall 2003, Machine Head released their fifth studio album, Through the Ashes of Empires, in Europe. In early 2004 they re-signed to Roadrunner Records in America and then released Through the Ashes of Empires in the US, featuring an additional then-new song (Seasons Wither) which had not appeared on the European release. Through the Ashes of Empires returned to a style closer to that of Burn My Eyes, and received significant publicity due to the success of the song Imperium and what was seen by fans as a massive return to form - both musically and lyrically. As part of this revival, Machine Head headlined the "True Metal" stage at 2005's Wacken Open Air festival in front of 40,000 fans - their biggest show to date. Through the Ashes of Empires debuted on the Billboard Charts in the US at #88 -- an excellent showing for a band that was considered at one point dead-in-the-water.

> On October 11, 2005, Machine Head released their first ever DVD: Elegies. The DVD contained concert footage from the Brixton Academy show in December of 2004. Elegies also contains 3 music videos: "The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears" (the audio from Hellalive dubbed over the video from 2004's With Full Force Festival appearance), "Imperium" and "Days Turn Blue to Gray" from Through The Ashes Of Empires. The DVD also contains a rather self-scathing documentary about the almost-demise of the band and how they survived the great burden imposed upon them by the record labels, the exiting of Ahrue Luster and the public's lack of faith in the band's musical direction. In the DVD's first week of release, "Elegies" reached the #13 spot in US and the #6 spot in UK music-related DVD sales.

> Machine Head contributed a studio recorded and produced cover of Metallica's Battery for Kerrang! Magazine's 'Remastered', a tribute to Metallica's seminal album Master of Puppets.

> The Blackening was released in March 2007 (26th UK, 27th US) to critical acclaim. The UK magazine Metal Hammer gave the album 10/10 and proclaimed it 'absolutely fucking stunning'. The UK version of the album included their cover of 'Battery' (as mentioned earlier) as a bonus track at the end of the album and a bonus DVD which featured a 'Making Of The Blackening' as well as live footage from Machine Head's appearances on the 2006 US Sounds of The Underground tour. The album was a hit worldwide, as it reached #16 in the Mainstream UK Album charts (surpassing their all-time first week sales in the UK), #54 in the US Billboard charts, #12 in the German charts (beating MH's previous first week sales record in Germany), #14 in Australian charts, #19 in Sweden, #23 in Ireland and #36 in the French album charts.

> Machine Headâs seventh full-length studio album Unto The Locust will be released worldwide on September 27, 2011. An "Advance Mix" of its title track was included on the 2011 Mayhem Festival iTunes sampler, which was released on June 14, 2011. (Locust Songfacts)

> On February 22, 2013, the band announced that Adam Duce left the band, albeit on friendly terms. 4 days later, Robb Flynn revealed in his online blog that he fired Adam Duce because of ongoing differences. His departure makes Flynn the only remaining original member.

> On June 24, 2013 the band announced that former Sanctity rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jared MacEachern has joined the band as their new bassist. Read more on Last.fm.

Guess I'm not seeing why what he did was better than those who came before him.  He hardly invented resampling.  His lyrics are great, but is that it?
You forgot the best one. Blue Rondo in 9/8.
Immortal.  Beautiful in its simplicity.
Al Green is INCREDIBLE live.
Sampling is stealing with a sense of entitlement.
I had front row seats to see Brubeck.  He was older and pretty feeble,  but when his fingers touched the keyboard, magic ensued.

**Ween**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/d6e775c719b14f839191e6a3deba48c6.png)  

> Ween is an experimental rock group formed in 1984 in New Hope, Pennsylvania, United States when Aaron Freeman (Gene Ween) and Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween) met in an eighth grade typing class. Ween collected a large underground fanbase despite being generally unknown in mainstream music circles aside from their 1992 fluke hit âPush th' Little Daisiesâ. 

> The band's style is eclectic, and while they could generally be referred to as rock, one of their defining tendencies has been experimentation with various styles incorporating a strong element of humor and absurdity. Both Gene and Dean are skilled multi-instrumentalists who overdubbed various instruments on their recordings, though they also record with the regular touring band.

> Their earliest home recordings were anarchic and free-spirited, drawing on influences as far-reaching as Beatles, Queen, Prince, Butthole Surfers, The Residents and the lo-fi punk movement. Ween was often compared in their early years to other offbeat artists such as Frank Zappa and would always eschew such comparisons.

> Ween was signed to Twin/Tone Records in 1989 and released their first album GodWeenSatan: The Oneness in the following year, a 26-track smorgasbord of wild eclecticism. 1991's The Pod became a fast fan favorite, as the duo's use of drum machines, pitch-tweaked guitars & vocals and drug-laced humor became a trademark part of their sound. The Pod, according to Ween-lore, was written under the influence of Scotchgard, but this was later refuted by Gene and Dean themselves as being "the most slime-bag thing we could think of." The contraption on the album cover is not a Scotchgard inhalation device, but a bong-like device used to send marijuana directly to the brain by use of nitrous oxide, which was said to leave the user intoxicated for days, but nauseated. The cover of The Pod used the cover of the 1975 Leonard Cohen album, The Best of Leonard Cohen, but with the head of Mean Ween (aka Chris "Cribber" Williams, a friend of the band) wearing the mask, pasted onto that of Cohen.

> Pure Guava, the first of a series of releases on the Elektra label, featured their highest charting single, "Push Th' Little Daisies" (1992) which gained them media & MTV attention, as the video was a highlighted target on MTV's Beavis & Butt-head. Chocolate and Cheese followed in 1994, heralding 70s pop/rock & soul sendups such as "Freedom of '76" and "Voodoo Lady". The "Freedom of '76" music video was directed by Spike Jonze. At this time, Ween began to expand their live and studio line-up, providing both a crisper production sound in the studio and an easier live setup (up until this time, Ween had been using DAT tapes to provide backings for their songs).

> Ween turned to Nashville studio musicians for the recording of the authentically-spirited 12 Golden Country Greats (1996) which only contained ten tracks. There are two theories regarding the title of the album. The first is that it refers to the dozen veteran Nashville studio musicians who played on the album. The second is that the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album, but upon the removal of the tracks "I Got No Darkside" and "So Long, Jerry" (the latter of which was a B-side on the "Piss Up A Rope" single) they decided not to rename it.

> The nautically-themed The Mollusk followed in 1997, demonstrating Ween's satirization, deconstruction, and appreciative mastery of genres including 1960's Brit-pop, sea shanties, Broadway show tunes, and especially progressive rock. Their desire to pursue alternate forms of media led to the MP3-only release Craters of the Sac (1999), presented by Dean for online download and free trade. Elektra Records released a live compilation entitled Paintin' The Town Brown: Ween Live 1990-1998 in 1999, followed by White Pepper (2000), their pop-themed album and final studio set for Elektra. The track "Even If You Don't" was made into a music video directed by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Shortly after White Pepper Ween started the internet radiostation WeenRadio, which was awarded 3rd best internet music site by Rolling Stone.[1]

> Ween also formed their own label at this time, Chocodog Records, which oversaw the release of several self-produced live sets. The aforementioned Paintin' the Town Brown, which was compiled and mastered by the band, was meant to be the first Chocodog release. According to Dean Ween, once the album was completed, Elektra realized the sales potential of the CD and denied Ween the right to release it through Chocodog. Later, Ween released the first official Chocodog album, Live in Toronto (a live recording from the 1996 tour, in which Ween performed with Bobby Ogdin & The Shit Creek Boys). The limited-pressing CD, available exclusively through the band website, became an instant collector's item. Subsequent Chocodog releases (Live at Stubb's and All Request Live) were produced in higher volumes to meet demand. In 2005, the label released the first instalment of a rarity compilation series entitled Shinola, and announced plans to re-release the 1987 cassette tape by Gene, Synthetic Socks.

> The two signed to Sanctuary Records in 2003 and released Quebec, their first studio set in 3 years. In 2004, they released Live in Chicago, a DVD and CD set that compiled tracks from three energetic live performances.

> In February of 2006, they rented an old farmhouse and converted it into a working studio. After writing over 50 songs and recording rough versions through 2006, they picked through them, and, with Andrew Weiss as producer, re-recorded album versions. As of March 2007, they are recording final versions of what they have said to be about 20 songs. On May 22, 2007 they announced they will be releasing an EP entitled "The Friends EP" on June 8th. Dean Ween said the EP will be "The ultimate party record, filled with good beats and good times. Perfect for your barbecue or doing bong hits or whatever it is that you guys do." And also they announced the new album--entitled "La Cucaracha"-- was released October 23, 2007 on Rounder Records, placing them on the same label as fellow Alternative Rock duo They Might Be Giants.

> Ween came to an end in May of 2012 when Freeman announced the band had split to Rolling Stone Magazine.

> In 2015 the band announced a series of reunion shows, starting with a three night stand in Colorado. In keeping with the prophecy, Boognish rose again.

This is the kind of answer I was hoping for.   Thanks
Correct, but in this era they were hardcore punk. It was later they became crossover thrash with How Will I Laugh Tomorrow.
I actually have this album on vinyl. An original from 1959, still sounds great! My aunt was giving away old records in storage.

what a year for Miles Davis
Question for anyone with more jazz knowledge than me: is this song called "Take Five" because it's five minutes long, because it's in 5/4 time, or because there are five instruments? I'm honestly not sure it could be any, all, or none of these.
Bless you for this.
"The Glitch Mob" man, listen to them.

1. Learn what sampling is.

2. Daft Punk has worked with Kanye directly, even after Stronger came out.

3. If you don't like his music that's fine but don't talk out your ass and act like its the truth.

> Bring Me the Horizon are a British metalcore band from Sheffield, Yorkshire, who formed in 2004. Bring Me the Horizon consists of lead vocalist Oliver Sykes, lead guitarist Lee Malia, rhythm guitarist Jona Weinhofen, bassist Matt Kean and drummer Matt Nicholls. They are currently signed to Visible Noise Records in the UK, Epitaph Records in the US and to Shock Records in Australia. Their music has been said to be influenced diversely by grindcore, death metal and emo, and their earlier work is noted for its strong influence from American metalcore bands. They have released three studio albums and one extended play.

> They released their debut album Count Your Blessings on 30 October 2006. Their second album, Suicide Season was released 29 September 2008 with a two disc special edition version titled: Suicide Season: Cut Up!, featuring a second disc of electronic and dubstep remixes of tracks featured on Suicide Season. Prior to the release of the special edition of Suicide Season, founding rhythm guitarist Curtis Ward left the band due to commitment issues. He was later replaced with Jona Weinhofen. Their third studio album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. was released 4 October 2010. Read more on Last.fm.

> Xandria is a German symphonic metal band that formed in Bielefeld, Germany, in 1994. According to the band, Xandria unifies modern rock with mystic soundscapes into a soundtrack of a different, really characteristic world.
1994 - 1997
A predecessor of the band was formed by Marco Heubaum (guitars, keyboards), drawing inspiration from Bands like Tiamat and Paradise Lost. This band was already named Xandria, but due to musical dissension between the members, they parted ways in 1997.

> 1999 - 2009
In 1999 Marco Heubaum started Xandria again with new musicians. A demo was recorded in 2000, and they presented the five songs on the internet. After great success on different MP3 portals, they released their first album Kill the Sun in 2003, which reached #98 on the German music charts. The sophomore Ravenheart (2004), stayed on the charts for 7 weeks, reaching #36. In 2005 they released their third album India, which is more oriented to the symphonic metal. Their fourth album SalomÃ© - The Seventh Veil, released in 2007, was a step away from the bombastic sound of the two predecessors and at least in Germany not such a big success as "Ravenheart" or "India". 

> 2009
As of April 30th, 2008 the band announced that Lisa left the band due to personal reasons and that the band is searching for a new singer. On February 8th, 2009 an announcement on their website introduced the new singer, 28-year old Kerstin Bischof, but on February 18th 2010 the band announced that Kerstin will no longer be the bands vocalist because she decided to pursue her career outside the music business.

> 2010
In December 2010 it was announced on Xandrias web site that  Manuela Kraller will be the new singer for the band. 
The new album "NeverworldÂ´s End" was released on February 24th 2012 (Europe) / March 6th 2012 (USA).

> 2013 - present
On the 25th of October 2013 the band announced Manuela's departure, who regrettably decided to continue a different musical path. Dutch singer Dianne van Giersbergen (also known from Ex Libris) was announced to become the new lead singer. In January 2014 the band announced the title for their upcoming album with Dianne called 'Sacrificium', which is set to be released on May the 2nd, 2014.

My best advice would be to really keep the corners of your mouth as tight as possible and try to push your bottom lip up. Practice with long tones as well. Play your favorite scale (B flat for example) starting at the normal good old B flat, playing each note for 8-12 counts at a decently slow tempo (75-90) and go up to the highest note that you can play comfortably without cracking or really straining. Then try to go one note higher for 4 counts. Do this when you warm up and warm down. Any time you play really. It should help strengthen your embouchure and keep your lips tight when you hit those high notes.
**Volbeat**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/34fadbf4deb84d1983094ca09ea397b1.png)  

> Volbeat is a heavy metal band from Denmark, founded in 2001. They released their first album, The Strength/the Sound/the Songs, in 2005 and the follow up, Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil, was released in Denmark on February 19, 2007, and in the rest of Europe on February 26, 2007. In March 2007, it topped the Danish album chart as the best selling album, the first metal album ever to do so.

> Volbeat was formed in 2001 after frontman Michael Poulsen split up his former band, Dominus. Volbeat plays a fusion of heavy metal and rockabilly. They are inspired by the rock n' roll legends Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. No other Danish heavy rock band Volbeat has been able to get to position 18 at the Danish Top 100 for CD sales in over 10 years. This milestone was reached after their concert at the Roskilde Festival 2006.

> Critics have generally been positive towards The Strength / The Sound / The Songs. The German hard rock magazine RockHard gave it 10/10 in a review.

> Volbeat is also praised for its live performances. Their concert at Roskilde Festival 2006 received a 6/6 stars review in the Danish newspaper BT.

> In week 8 of 2007, the record Rock The Rebel / Metal The Devil debuted as #1 in the Danish Top 40 for CD-sales and at the same time The Strength / The Sound / The Songs re-entered the chart at #21. Recently, the album achieved gold status for sales in Denmark.

> Volbeat opened the Roskilde Festival in 2007. Volbeat also supported Metallica together with Mnemic at their concert on Denmark July 13 of that year.

> More recently, Volbeat was announced to do a seven-date European spring tour and to support legendary speed metal act Megadeth in Finland and in their home town, Copenhagen. They have also already announced a few festival appearances for the summer 2008.

> Volbeat has a large range of influences, which can be clearly heard in their music. On their official MySpace site Volbeat lists their influences in their own recognizable way:

> "Everything from Elvis Presley to Napalm Death .. hail: Johnny Cash, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Ramones, Social Distortion, MotÃ¶rhead, Black Sabbath, Dio, Megadeth, Metallica, Manic Street Preachers, Iron Maiden and bla bla bla bla..."

> Volbeat's lyrics usually revolve around love, failed love or the power of a twisted mind. They thereby distance themselves from stereotypical heavy metal lyrics, although many of their most popular songs have very dark or sincere themes and plots.

> Their first single was the cover version of Dusty Springfield's evergreen "I Only Wanna Be With You". The song doesn't differ much from the original with regard to the lyrics, but the accompanying music video is quite typical of Volbeat. In it, the band is seen with a classic microphone on top of a city roof.

> Another popular feature of the band's lyrics are the returning "series" of songs. This is best represented with the songs "Danny & Lucy (11 pm)" and "Fire Song" from The Strength/The Sound/The Songs followed by "Mr. & Mrs. Ness" on Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil. The story is about the two desperate lovers, Danny and Lucy, who are killed in a car crash after Lucy runs away from her family.

> "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ness, I'm so sorry to bring you this - We believe we found your girl in an old burning car way up the hill"

> In the successor, "Mr. & Mrs. Ness", Lucy's mother commits suicide and the father is suspected for the murder:

> "The old man is crying and he's lying - The blood on his hands' from his wife yeah"

> The story is followed further by "Mary Ann's Place" from Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood, and was concluded with "You Will Know" off 2016's Seal the Deal & Let's Boogie.

> Lineup

> Michael Poulsen - Vocals, guitar (ex-Dominus)
Rob Caggiano - Guitar (ex-Anthrax)
Kaspar Boye Larsen - Bass
Jon Larsen - Drums

> Former members:

> Teddy Vang - Guitar
Franz Gottschalk - Guitar
Thomas Bredahl - Guitar
Anders KjÃ¸lholm - Bass

**Animals as Leaders**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5e91aad872634d07aa96d337be859542.png)  

> Animals as Leaders is a Washington, D.C. based instrumental progressive metal project formed by guitarist Tosin Abasi in 2007. Their self-titled debut album was released in April 2009 by Prosthetic Records.

> Animals as Leaders was formed "out of the ashes" of guitarist Tosin Abasi's previous band, Reflux. The heavy metal record label Prosthetic Records saw Abasi's guitar work and asked him to create a solo album for them. Abasi initially declined, feeling such an endeavor would be "egotistical and unnecessary". When Reflux disbanded, Abasi decided to take the label's offer. The name Animals as Leaders was inspired by Daniel Quinn's 1992 novel Ishmael, which addresses anthropocentrism. Abasi coined the name as a reminder "that we're all essentially animals".

> The project's first album, Animals as Leaders, was recorded in early 2008. Abasi recorded all guitar and bass tracks on the album; drums and various synthesized effects were programmed by engineer Misha Mansoor. The album was released April 28, 2009 by Prosthetic Records.

> Their second album, Weightless, was released November 8, 2011, with the addition of Javier Reyes and Navene Koperweis on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively. After touring in support of the record, it was announced that Navene Koperweis would be leaving the band. He was replaced by Matt Garstka for further touring duties. 

> It was announced in late December of 2012 that Animals As Leaders had signed a deal with Sumerian Records, who will release the band's next album in 2013. The album is going to be produced by Misha Mansoor, from Periphery.

**No Doubt**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/3bce7eba7568442f9ef1c91709fd5b16.png)  

> Formed in 1986 in Anaheim, California, United States as a ska punk band inspired by Madness, the lineup of No Doubt initially comprised John Spence as lead vocal, Gwen Stefani on back-up vocal, and Eric Stefani on keyboards. While playing the party-band circuit around Anaheim, the trio picked up bassist Tony Kanal. Hardened by the suicide of Spence in December 1987, No Doubt nevertheless continued; Gwen became the lone vocalist and the group added guitarist Tom Dumont and drummer Adrian Young. During their early years on the party scene, they played with Sublime, and Brad Nowell sang on No Doubt's Total Hate 95. Gwen Stefani returned the favour on Saw Red.
No Doubt's live act began to attract regional interest, and Interscope Records signed them in 1991. The band's debut a year later, an odd fusion of '80s and ska, sank without a trace in the wake of the grunge movement. As a result, Interscope refused to support No Doubt's tour or further recordings. The band responded by recording on their own during 1993-94; the result was the self-released The Beacon Street Collection, much rawer and more punk-inspired than the debut. Eric Stefani left just after its release, later working as an animator for The Simpsons. By late 1994, Interscope allowed recordings to resume, and Tragic Kingdom was released in October 1995. The album's third single, Don't Speak, which although originally written by Eric was later altered by Gwen to document her breakup with bassist Tony Kanal. Tragic Kingdom went platinum and has sold over 15 million copies to date. As Tragic Kingdom obtained success, the band toured furiously until late '97. 

> After a long break, the band had prepared a more mellow, and powerfully dramatic album entitled Return of Saturn. It emphasized Gwen's encounters with men, her biological clock, and miscellaneous topics. Although the album had a completely different approach to it, the band was making rock music with less of a punk/ska flare. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard charts in early April of 2000, and then declined to a flop. The public never did justice to the album, and it serves as a favorite for many die-hard fans.

> While touring in Jamaica for Return of Saturn, the band wanted to try adding Reggae to their music, and making more of a dance rock record. 20 months after Return of Saturn debuted, the band was quick to jump on the creation of Rock Steady, released in December of '01. The singles Underneath It All and Hey Baby became international dance club symbols as top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. This album proved that No Doubt had not lost their potential with the public, and that they could appeal to various groups of people. 

> In 2004, No Doubt announced they would be going on hiatus after the release of the singles compilation The Singles 1992â2003, which contained one new song, a cover of experimental rock band Talk Talk's "It's My Life". Tony Kanal did several projects with Gwen and other artists. Adrian Young married and had a child; Tom Dumont formed a new band, Invincible Overlord, often plays with Matt Costa's band. Gwen embarked on a sucessful solo career which consisted of two albums - "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." and "The Sweet Escape". The first of these albums contains the single "Hollaback Girl", a song which was inescapable for most of 2005 and hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won her a Billboard Award for first track to reach 1 Million legal downloads ever. The self titled track off "The Sweet Escape" went on to become her most notorious calling card.

> With the hiatus officially over in late 2008 No Doubt announced tour plans for 2009, kicking it off in Atlantic City.  The tour concluded with four dates in Irvine, CA. In May, 2009, the band was featured as a fictional 80's band, "Snowed Out", on CW Network's "Gossip Girl"  The band performed their cover of Adam and the Ants 'Stand and Deliver.'

> The group entered the studio in May 2010 to start recording on their sixth studio album: Push and Shove which will be release on September 25, 2012 and its first single will be "Settle Down". Their first music video for the new album will also be for "Settle Down" and it will be directed by Sophie Muller (who previously has done numerous music videos for No Doubt). The whole album has been recorded with producer Mark "Spike" Stent (who worked on their previous album Rock Steady) but they have also collaborated with Major Lazer (now Diplo's solo project). No Doubt previously revealed they are taking influence from ska, 80s new wave and Jamaican reggae music for the new record. Read more on Last.fm.

Flawless Execution
No lyrics and a good beat is what I need to get work done. [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i_eMl3C1fA) by the Young Lovers is my most recent favorite.
That's really nothing new, except for the autotune (and I'm sure people would have used it in the past if it was available).  In the 50's and 60's, the top of the billboard charts was full of sappy love songs.  And lots of procedurally generated rubish (a huge number of popular songs in the late 50's and early 60's used the same I-vi-IV-V progression, and the 12 bar blues progression has been used in a lot of popular songs since the early 1900's.).  And a fair amount of songs about drugs and sex too.

And the same would be true of the classical, baroque, and romantic eras if audio recording existed and anyone could record a song.

**Switchfoot**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/181914956a584663a96d665df3089b6f.png)  

> Switchfoot is a Grammy-winning alternative rock band from San Diego, California, United States. The band was formed in 1996 with the brothers Jon Foreman (lead singer/guitarist) and Tim Foreman (bass). Long-time friend Chad Butler (drums) joined soon after.  Eventually the band evolved to what it is today with the addition of members Jerome Fontamillas (key/guitar/electronics - formerly of Mortal and Fold Zandura) and Drew Shirley (guitar - formerly of All Together Separate). 

> Although the band started out playing at Christian music festivals, they shun the label of "Christian rock," with singer and guitarist Jon Foreman saying, "For us, it's a faith, not a genre. We've always been very open and honest about where the songs are coming from. For us, these songs are for everyone. Calling us `Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind -- and that's what we want."  They started out on Charlie Peacock's label "re:think" and spent several years appearing at Christian festivals and enjoying Christian radio hits. Most of their early tours were with Christian bands and both of the band's new members were borrowed from Christian bands.

> Switchfoot did not see success outside of the Christian rock scene until they were featured alongside singer Mandy Moore on the A Walk To Remember soundtrack. The band's first true commercial success came in 2003 with the release of their fourth major label (and first mainstream label) offering, The Beautiful Letdown. The album went on to sell more than 2 million albums and Switchfoot became the most popular rock band to be associated with Christian music.

> They were featured on the British Edition of the Spiderman II soundtrack along with the likes of Taking Back Sunday and Dashboard Confessional to name a few, in 2004 with the song 'Meant To Live'.

> In 2005 Switchfoot released "Nothing Is Sound". The album went gold within 3 months and received much critical acclaim.

> Switchfoot's highly anticipated album, titled "Oh! Gravity." was released on December 26th, 2006. 

> On November 10th, 2009, Switchfoot released their first album produced under their own label, lowercase people.  "Mess of Me", a single from the album released months before the CD, has enjoy chart-topping radio plays since its release.

> In 2010 Switchfoot released their album, "Hello Hurricane".

> On September 27th, 2011, to much anticipation and excitement, Switchfoot released their newest album, "Vice Verses".

You're right, I should've called it "go-fuck-yourself-for-getting-angry-about-internet-points-and-not-enjoying-good-music jazz." 

I could also call it the "you're-a-jackass-and-if-you-want-new-music-stop-ignoring-every-song-in-the-sub-you-haven't-already-heard jazz."

It's just so hard these days to pick a fitting genre, you know?

Sister Goldenhair was a better tune. This song always sounded to me like they were just out to rip off Neil Young.
As much as I love this song 5/4 is a pain in the ass to play in. Just far enough from standard time that slipping into 4/4 is so easy. Took a lot of time to get it down.

I'm usually really polite to people on Reddit, but you caught me on a fuck you kind of day.  So, go fuck yourself.
Hip-hop originated from ripping off songs, that's what it's all about. Kanye first 4 or 5 albums have some of the best sampled beats ever a long with some great lyrics. It wasn't until after yeezus in my opinion and marrying Kim K that he got this self inflated ego.
You've got a great point. People pretty much upvote this or stuff that isn't actually jazz.

"This 'catchy country-infused sing-along' has 'taken on the status of "Free Bird"'â'in that it has become a bar room staple that drunks love to loudly request at every show,Â regardlessÂ of who the band is.'" - Wikipedia

Looks like that circles it back to being Free Bird then.

Miles Davis's *Kind of  Blue* is a great introductory jazz album, also the bestselling jazz album of all time. Once you've listened to that, look up all the musicians on that album and find an album that they each recorded as a leader, and then do the same thing to those albums etc.

Of course, in my opinion, the best way to experience jazz is to follow it from the beginning all the way through today. The first recording of jazz was "Livery Stable Blues" in 1917 by "The Original Dixieland Jass Band" (fun fact, not the first jazz band, or even an authentic one). And after that, there's lots of what's known as traditional jazz (Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Sidney Bechet, etc.). 

I could go on, but the easiest way to get a reference point for all of this is to watch Ken Burns' documentary series on jazz. It's very informative, and makes every recording that much more interesting once you understand the history behind it. It's all on Netflix last time I checked. Along with the show, there's a list of key recordings and musicians to check out.

**Charlie Puth**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/7edd2e7fa8c2ba021f2ba2ef40d1fc29.png)  

> Charlie Puth (born Charles Otto Puth, Jr., December 2, 1991 in Rumson, New Jersey, United States) is a American pop singer from New Jersey who gained his fame through YouTube. He is best known for his 2015 debut single "Marvin Gaye", which features vocals from Meghan Trainor. He is also known for singing on Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again" taken from the "Furious 7" soundtrack. The single became a huge international success, reaching number one in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United States as well as the top ten in Ireland and France.

> Charlie joined YouTube in September of 2009 and began to post his own acoustic covers. He is also an alumnus of the Berklee College of Music, which he graduated in 2013. In October 2011, Ellen DeGeneres announced that she had signed Charlie Puth and Emily Luther to her label after seeing their cover of Adele's "Someone Like You". Puth and Luther performed the song on the show. On January 25, 2012, they came back to The Ellen DeGeneres Show and performed Lady Antebellum's "Need You Now" and an original written by Puth titled "Break Again" (co-written with Robert Gillies). Charlie has since left eleveneleven and signed with Atlantic Records.

> In February 2015 he released his debut single "Marvin Gaye"; the song features vocals from Meghan Trainor. He features on Wiz Khalifa's song "See You Again", which features on the Furious 7 soundtrack which went to number one on the Hot 100 making his first entry and first top 10 on the Hot 100. He co-wrote the song "Slow Motion" for Trey Songz and has arranged sessions with Jason Derulo and Lil Wayne. In an interview with Billboard, Puth explains the vibe he wanted for his upcoming EP. "I listened to a lot of Marvin Gaye and Motown records. When I was making my record, I just wanted to make this soulful sound. When Marvin Gaye made his music, he evoked this feeling that would reach everybody. Now, my record is also actually a musical assistance record".

Why do I have to log in to a Facebook account? I don't have one, and I don't want to have one just to do this.
Speaking of Radiohead, someone did jazz ensemble arrangements for some of their songs and they're so cool and a ton of fun to play.

Love this album. Home Invasion is one of my favorites on this one but the whole album is great.
Rest in Peace Dave Brubeck
Love these guys. This album and Congratulations especially.
Video game scores are great for this. They're intentionally meant to create ambience but not totally distract you from what you're doing. Some good options:

[Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hFN8UrBPw)

[L.A. Noire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfA9GccfWI)

[Not a video game soundtrack but The Social Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yydZbVoCbn0)
I would suggest classical, if you need to focus it will be non disruptive background and it actually has what you're looking for....
Great track, but if you want the best Brubeck album, you need to go with the album At Carnegie Hall.  Jazz is always best live and the performances on this album are exemplary.  Nearly every track deserves a regular listen.  Including this version of OP:

**The Housemartins**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/856e95209b724a60b0f4af004316259d.png)  

> The Housemartins were an indie pop/alternative rock band which formed in 1983 in Kingston upon Hull, England. At its formation the band consisted of Paul Heaton (vocals), Stan Cullimore (guitar), Ted Key (bass) and Chris Lang (drums). The band's membership changed frequently throughout its existence. Ted Key was replaced by Norman Cook (who later became internationally famous as big beat musician Fatboy Slim) and drummer Chris Lang was replaced by Hugh Whitaker, former drummer with The Gargoyles, who in turn was replaced with Dave Hemingway. The band split in 1988.

> The band often referred to themselves as "the 4th best band in Hull," referring to Kingston upon Hull, the city in England where the band formed in 1983. (The three bands that were "better" were Red Guitars, Everything but the Girl, and The Gargoyles.)

> In 1986, the band broke through with the single Happy Hour, which reached No. 3 in the UK charts helped by a claymation animated pop promo of a type that was in vogue at the time. At the end of the same year, they had a No. 1 single with a cover version of Isley Jasper Isley's Caravan of Love.

> The band released three albums: London 0 Hull 4, The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death, and the greatest bits compilation Now That's What I Call Quite Good.  A new collection, Best of the Housemartins, was released in 2004, and was available in a expanded edition with a DVD collecting their music video clips.

> The Housemartins lyrics were an odd mixture of Marxist politics and born-again Christianity, reflecting Paul Heaton's beliefs at the time.

> The band split in 1988, but the members have since remained friends and worked on each other's projects. Norman Cook has enjoyed significant success with both Beats International and then as Fatboy Slim, while Heaton, Hemingway and roadie Sean Welch formed The Beautiful South.  Stan Cullimore has become an author of children's books.  Despite repeated requests from fans, they have never reformed.

> In 1993, former drummer Hugh Whitaker was convicted of assault after attacking his business partner James Hewitt with an axe. Whitaker has since been released from prison and now resides in Leeds, where he occasionally drums with local band Percy, Whitaker is also a member of The Malkies fronted by Alistair Hulett

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5956eda3cbb34ae694809da8c56b2f53.png)  

> Kimberley Dawn Locke (born January 3, 1978 in Hartsville, Tennessee) is an American adult contemporary pop/R&B singer and plus-size fashion model. In recent years, Locke has had eight Top 20 Adult Contemporary hits, and seven #1's across various Billboard charts.

> She gained fame with her participation in the 2003 American Idol television series, and in 2007 garnered media attention for her participation in Celebrity Fit Club.

> Her debut album, One Love, was released May 4, 2004. Debut single "8th World Wonder" reached the top half of the Billboard Hot 100 and was successful on other charts, and even entered the UK chart with little promotion. "Wrong" and "I Could" followed as singles and were hits on the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts respectively. "Coulda Been" was the album's only single not to chart.

> Locke's second album, Based On A True Story, was released on May 1, 2007. The album's original lead single, "Supawoman", co-written with her producers Damon Sharpe and Mark J. Feist, was released to radio August 7, 2006, however after underwhelming radio support, Curb Records decided to refocus. "Change", was released to radio on January 15, 2007 to positive support and climbed the charts well into the summer of 2007. The album's next single is a cover of Freda Payne's "Band Of Gold", which was released to radio on August 13, 2007 and became Locke's 6th solo Adult Contemporary Top 10 hit. The album's third single has been announced to be "Fall", a song also recorded by country music artist Clay Walker, which is being released to radio in February 2008. Read more on Last.fm.

Shrek 2.....a song about heroin.....
I always recommend Art Blakey & The Jazz Messenger's *Moanin'* because it's such a perfect gateway album. The Jazz Messengers were an ever rotating cast of musicians, so there's tons to dig into and tangents to explore. Thelonious Monk's *Straight, No Chaser* too. I'd definitely check out Miles Davis Quintet (his first quintet), albums like *Workin'* and *Cookin'*. His second quintet was equally incredible but it's more advanced listening. If you're ready for it, check out *E.S.P.*, *Miles Smiles*, and the live album *Four & More*. Hope that helps!
Are you guys coming at Quebec soon ?
To this day my favourite drum solo.

Edit: "But in Latin, the cat's name was 'Procul' with a 'u' and 'Harun' with an 'n' on the end, 'Beyond these things' in Latin. We got round to saying that Procol Harum in fact meant 'Beyond these things', which was a nice coincidence: at least it didn't mean, 'I'm going to town to buy a cow' or something."

Hey man, you seem to know your jazz, do you have any must-listen albums of instrumental jazz you'd recommend to someone who's only just getting into the genre?
Gold & Silver by Quicksilver Messenger Service sounds quite similar.
This song is what got me into jazz in the first place. Major soft spot for the Brubeck Quartet.
Matt & Kim are the tops.

I'm actually a full classical guy now. I found that I wasn't too good at Jazz when i was playing it. I still listen to a lot of jazz but I don't really play it anymore. My entire group all really likes jazz fusion. Chick Corea, Al Dimeola, tribal tech, things like that. We'd spend entire days popping on some fusion and sip coffee together and just chill. I think the closest we got to gypsey was when we played Green Dolphin Street by Sonny Rollins at like 350 bpm and someone mocked that it was just like gypsey jazz.

There's a really interesting version of this song blended with the doors iconic piano riff I found on sound cloud. 

https://m.soundcloud.com/markane/take-five-the-doors-version

I like getting high and listening to this. It makes me feel something special.
Performed this song on guitar just yesterday night. Great tune!
Agreed.

All apologies /u/mcleafer but your post has been automatically removed because  the artist [was posted too recently](/r/Music/comments/59eam0/violent_femmes_blister_in_the_sun_1983/?ref=search_posts).

If you think this is in error or this is a new release (within the last two week), please [contact the mods](/message/compose?to=/r/Music&subject=Post removed in error.&message=https://reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5b016r/violent_femmes_add_it_up_alternative_rock/).

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music.

Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)

Why is this saying it's not available in the USA?
It's astounding how mere months after The Ramones' first record dropped, there were suddenly dozens of amazing punk bands all over the world. The LA scene in the late 70s/early 80s was such a fertile time for punk music, especially hardcore which was taking its first baby steps at the time. Love this band and record so much!
